# Fire In Wet Conditions

## Overview
Starting a fire in wet conditions is one of the most challenging yet crucial survival skills. Dampness, rain, and high humidity make finding and igniting suitable materials incredibly difficult. However, mastering this skill is vital for warmth, cooking, water purification, morale, and signaling in any survival scenario where conditions are less than ideal. This guide focuses on techniques to overcome moisture and successfully establish a life-sustaining flame.

## Materials Needed
*   **Ignition Source:** Waterproof matches, lighter (butane or plasma), ferrocerium rod with striker, magnifying glass (if sunny), or fire piston.
*   **Tinder:** Extremely fine, dry, and easily ignitable material. Examples include:
    *   Inner bark of birch or cedar (shredded finely)
    *   Dried grasses or leaves (crushed)
    *   Fungus (e.g., Chaga, artist's conk, punkwood)
    *   Commercial fire starters (petroleum jelly cotton balls, dryer lint, char cloth, fatwood shavings)
*   **Kindling:** Small, dry twigs and sticks, ranging from pencil-lead thin to pencil-thick.
*   **Fuelwood:** Larger, dry branches and split logs.
*   **Tools:** Knife (for processing materials), small saw or hatchet (for processing larger wood), tarp or poncho (for shelter and keeping materials dry).
*   **Platform Material:** Rocks, larger dry logs, or split wood to create an elevated, dry base.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Site Selection & Preparation:**
    *   **Find Shelter:** Locate a spot protected from direct rain and wind, such as under a thick evergreen tree, a rock overhang, or by constructing a quick lean-to shelter with a tarp or natural materials.
    *   **Clear the Ground:** Clear a 3-foot (1-meter) diameter area down to bare earth to prevent ground fires.
    *   **Build a Dry Platform:** On the cleared ground, create an elevated, dry base. Use flat rocks, larger dry logs laid side-by-side, or split pieces of wood. This prevents the fire from drawing moisture from the ground and allows better airflow underneath.

2.  **Gather Materials (The DRY Hunt):**
    *   **Tinder (Critical):** This is the hardest to find dry. Look under logs, inside hollow standing dead trees, under rock overhangs, or on the underside of thick branches of evergreens. Prioritize inner bark of birch or cedar (peel carefully), very dry fine grasses/leaves (often found in bird nests), or punkwood from rotten logs. Process all tinder by shredding it into the finest possible fibers to increase surface area. You need a golf-ball to softball-sized amount.
    *   **Kindling:** Search for small, dry twigs. Standing deadwood often has drier branches than fallen wood. Look for dead branches still attached to trees, especially on the leeward side. Split larger pieces of kindling with your knife to expose the dry interior. Gather a large armload of progressively thicker kindling, from pencil-lead to thumb-sized.
    *   **Fuelwood:** Focus on standing deadwood or logs that are elevated off the wet ground. These are generally drier than those in direct contact with moisture. If you must use wet wood, split it repeatedly with your knife or hatchet to reach the dry core. Gather a significant supply—at least an armload of wrist-thick pieces and several
