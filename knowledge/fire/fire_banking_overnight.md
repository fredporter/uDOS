## Overview

In a wilderness survival situation, managing your fire effectively is crucial for warmth, safety, and morale, especially during the long, cold hours of the night. While an active fire provides immediate benefits, maintaining it requires constant attention and a significant supply of fuel. Fire banking is a highly valuable technique that allows you to preserve the heat and life of your fire, reducing it to a slow, smoldering state, ensuring you have a viable ember or hot coals that can be easily revived in the morning without the arduous task of starting a new fire from scratch.

The core principle of fire banking is to restrict the oxygen supply to your fire, causing large, dense logs to smolder very slowly rather than burning with an open flame. This process conserves fuel, extends the lifespan of your heat source, and minimizes the work required to restart a fire when daylight returns. Instead of waking up to a completely cold fire pit, you'll find a bed of hot coals or even slowly burning logs, ready to be fanned back into a roaring blaze with minimal effort and resources.

Beyond the practical benefits of fuel efficiency and easy re-ignition, a banked fire provides immense psychological comfort. Knowing you have a reliable source of heat and light to return to can significantly reduce stress and improve sleep in a survival scenario. Mastering fire banking transforms your fire from a demanding, temporary necessity into a low-maintenance, continuous asset, vital for long-term comfort and survival in the wild.

## Materials Needed

*   **Established Fire:** A robust campfire with a strong bed of glowing coals and some well-burning logs.
*   **Banking Logs:** 1-3 large, dense, green, or partially seasoned hardwood logs (e.g., oak, maple, hickory, mesquite, dense conifer species like pine or fir in a pinch, but hardwoods are superior). These should be too large to burn quickly, approximately 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) in diameter and 2-4 feet (60-120 cm) long.
*   **Covering Material:**
    *   **Ash/Dry Mineral Earth/Sand:** The safest and most effective materials for banking. Ensure it is free of flammable organic matter.
    *   **Mud/Clay:** Can be used, but must be applied carefully to avoid smothering too quickly or cracking.
*   **Digging/Moving Tool:** A sturdy stick, shovel, trowel, or flat rock for consolidating coals and moving covering material.
*   **Tinder & Kindling:** A fresh supply of very fine, dry tinder and progressively sized kindling for morning re-ignition.
*   **Water/Dirt:** For safety, in case of accidental spread or sparks.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Fire for Banking

The success of your banked fire depends on the quality of your initial fire and the selection of banking logs.

1.  **Build a Strong Coal Bed:** Allow your campfire to burn down for several hours until you have a substantial bed of hot, glowing coals. This thermal mass is crucial for igniting and sustaining the banking logs.
2.  **Select Banking Logs:** Choose 1-3 of the largest, densest, and preferably green or partially seasoned hardwood logs you have. These logs will smolder slowly, providing a consistent heat source throughout the night. Avoid bone-dry, punky wood as it will burn too quickly or turn to ash.
    *   *Tip:* Green logs contain moisture, which slows their combustion. Partially seasoned logs are a good compromise, providing more heat than fully green wood but burning slower than completely dry wood.
3.  **Consolidate Coals:** Use your digging tool to rake all the hot, glowing coals into a compact pile in the center of your fire pit. This creates a concentrated heat source for the banking logs.

### 2. Banking the Logs (Overnight Slow Burn)

This is the primary method for keeping logs smoldering for easy re-ignition in the morning.

1.  **Place Banking Logs:** Carefully place your selected banking logs directly on top of, or nestled within, the consolidated coal bed.
    *   *Arrangement:* Arrange the logs so they are touching the hottest coals, often in a "log cabin" or parallel fashion, ensuring good contact for initial ignition of the logs themselves.
    *   *Oxygen Control:* For a very slow burn, try to arrange them to restrict airflow slightly, but not completely smother them initially.
2.  **Allow Logs to Catch:** Give the banking logs 10-20 minutes to absorb heat and begin to smolder and char. You want them actively smoldering, perhaps even with a small flame occasionally, before banking them.
3.  **Cover with Ash/Dirt:** Once the banking logs are thoroughly hot and smoldering, carefully shovel or scoop a generous layer of fine ash, dry mineral earth, or sand over the entire fire, including the banking logs and the surrounding coals.
    *   *Layer Thickness:* Aim for a consistent layer of 3-6 inches (7-15 cm) over the logs. The goal is to restrict oxygen flow significantly but not completely extinguish the smoldering process.
4.  **Create a Vent (Optional, for longer, slower burn):** For very long banking or in extremely cold conditions where you want minimal heat loss, you can leave a *very small* opening or "chimney" in the covering material on the upwind side, or at one end of a buried log. This allows a tiny amount of oxygen to maintain the smolder. This requires careful monitoring initially.
5.  **Pat Down:** Gently pat down the covering material to create a denser, more insulating layer and to reduce any unwanted airflow.
6.  **Safety Check:** Double-check that no sparks are escaping and no flammable materials are near the covering. A small amount of smoke might escape; this is normal for banking. If you see flames, you need more cover.

### 3. Monitoring and Safety During the Night

A banked fire requires less attention than an active fire, but it's not entirely maintenance-free.

*   **Occasional Checks:** If possible, check your banked fire periodically during the night, especially during the first few hours. Look for excessive smoke (too much oxygen, logs burning too fast) or a complete lack of any smoke/heat (fire might have gone out).
*   **Adjust Cover:** If the fire seems to be burning too quickly, add more covering material. If it appears to be going out, gently fan a small opening to allow more oxygen.
*   **Smell for CO:** If banking near a shelter, be acutely aware of any smells (or lack thereof) that could indicate carbon monoxide.

### 4. Re-Ignition in the Morning

Waking up to a banked fire means an easy start to your day.

1.  **Locate & Uncover:** Carefully locate your banked fire. Gently remove the covering material using your digging tool, exposing the banking logs and the hot coals beneath. You should find the logs still smoldering or at least extremely hot and charred.
2.  **Consolidate & Expose:** Rake the smoldering logs and hot coals into a compact pile, exposing as much surface area as possible to the air.
3.  **Add Tinder:** Place a small amount of very fine, dry tinder (e.g., cattail fluff, scraped birch bark, char cloth, petroleum jelly cotton balls) directly onto the hottest part of the smoldering logs or glowing coals.
4.  **Gentle Airflow:** Cup your hands around the tinder and smoldering wood/coals, and blow gently and consistently onto it. Provide a steady stream of oxygen. As smoke increases, blow a little harder until the tinder ignites.
5.  **Kindling Progression:** Once the tinder ignites into a flame, carefully add the smallest kindling in a teepee or lean-to fashion. Gradually increase the size of the kindling, nurturing the flame until it is self-sustaining.

## Safety Considerations

*   **Underground Fires:** This is the highest risk with fire banking. NEVER bank a fire or bury smoldering logs in an area with dry organic matter, leaves, roots, or peat moss. Smoldering wood can ignite these materials, leading to an underground fire that can spread undetected for days or weeks. Always use pure mineral earth, sand, or ash as covering material.
*   **Carbon Monoxide (CO):** A banked fire, by design, operates with reduced oxygen, which increases the production of carbon monoxide (CO). If banking near an enclosed shelter, ensure *adequate and continuous ventilation*. CO is odorless, colorless, and deadly. Never bring smoldering logs into a tent or other confined space.
*   **Burns:** The ground and covering material above a banked fire will become extremely hot. Mark the area clearly and avoid stepping on it. Be cautious when uncovering.
*   **Full Extinguishment:** Before finally abandoning any fire, banked or not, ensure it is completely extinguished. Drown it with water, stir the ashes, and check for any remaining heat or embers. Repeat until cool to the touch.
*   **Site Stability:** Ensure that any windbreaks or fire pit walls are stable and won't collapse during the night.

## Common Mistakes

*   **Using Dry, Fast-Burning Wood:** Attempting to bank small, dry logs or softwoods will result in them burning out quickly, leaving no coals or embers in the morning.
*   **Not Enough Coals:** The banking logs need a substantial bed of hot coals to properly ignite and sustain their smoldering.
*   **Burying in Flammable Earth:** The most dangerous mistake, leading to potential wildfires. Always use mineral earth/ash.
*   **Too Much Oxygen:** If the cover isn't thick enough or there are too many gaps, the logs will burn too quickly, effectively just being a normal fire that burns out.
*   **Too Little Oxygen:** Covering too densely without any initial smolder, or sealing too tightly, can smother the fire completely, leaving you with cold logs.
*   **Not Marking the Spot:** It's easy to lose track of the banked fire's exact location, especially in the dark or early morning, leading to wasted time or accidental burns.
*   **Ignoring CO Risk:** Underestimating the danger of carbon monoxide from a slow-smoldering fire, especially if it's near or partially under a shelter.
*   **Improper Re-ignition:** Being too aggressive or too gentle with airflow, or not having fine tinder ready, can cause the smoldering logs/coals to cool down rather than reignite.
