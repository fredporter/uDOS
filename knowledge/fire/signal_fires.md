# Signal Fires: Attracting Attention in the Wilderness

## Overview

Signal fires are a critical survival tool used to attract the attention of potential rescuers from a distance. By generating large plumes of smoke during the day or bright flames at night, they serve as a powerful visual beacon indicating your location and distress. Mastering the construction and maintenance of a signal fire significantly increases your chances of being found.

## Materials Needed

*   **Ignition Source:** Waterproof matches, lighter, ferrocerium rod, or magnifying glass.
*   **Tinder:** Extremely fine, dry, and easily ignitable material (e.g., birch bark shavings, dry grass, cotton balls, fine wood shavings).
*   **Kindling:** Small, dry sticks and twigs, roughly pencil-sized or smaller, to build up the initial flame.
*   **Main Fuel:** Larger, dry branches and logs, ranging from wrist-thick to forearm-thick, for a long-lasting and intense fire.
*   **Smoke Material (Daytime):** Green, damp foliage (leaves, pine needles), moss, damp grass, or even oily rags/rubber (use sparingly due to toxic fumes).
*   **Tools (Optional but Recommended):** Knife or small axe for processing wood, shovel for clearing a fire pit.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Select Your Site:** Choose a location that is high, open, and clearly visible from all directions, especially potential search paths (e.g., ridgelines, clearings, shorelines). Ensure it's downwind from your camp to avoid smoke nuisance, but upwind from any potential search areas. Clear a circular area at least 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter of all flammable debris down to bare earth or rock.
2.  **Prepare Your Fire Pit:** If on bare earth, dig a shallow pit or create a ring of rocks to contain the fire. This helps concentrate heat and prevents spreading.
3.  **Gather Fuel:** Systematically collect abundant amounts of tinder, kindling, main fuel, and smoke material. *Crucially, gather enough main fuel to sustain the fire for several hours, and have your smoke material piled nearby, ready for immediate use.*
4.  **Build Your Signal Pyre:**
    *   **Distress Signal Structure:** For maximum impact, build three separate fires in an equilateral triangle, with each fire about 50-100 feet (15-30 meters) apart. This is a universally recognized distress signal.
    *   **Single Pyre Construction:** If building one, construct a large, sturdy base of main fuel logs (e.g., a log cabin or criss-cross structure) with a large cavity in the center. Inside this cavity, place a generous amount of tinder and then kindling in a tepee or lean-to arrangement. The goal is a structure that can be ignited quickly and burn intensely.
    *   **Watch Fire (Optional but Recommended):** If you plan to maintain a signal fire for an extended period, build a smaller, separate "watch fire" nearby. This allows you to keep embers alive without constantly burning your main signal pyre, saving fuel until
