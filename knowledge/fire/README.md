## ⚠️ Critical Safety Rules

**Before Starting:**
- [ ] Check local fire restrictions/bans
- [ ] Clear 3m diameter to mineral soil
- [ ] Water or sand for extinguishing nearby
- [ ] Know wind direction and speed
- [ ] Identify fire escape route

**During Fire:**
- [ ] Never leave unattended
- [ ] Keep fire size appropriate (cooking/warmth only)
- [ ] Monitor for sparks/embers spreading
- [ ] Maintain control at all times
- [ ] Keep children/pets at safe distance

**After Fire:**
- [ ] Drown with water (not bury with dirt first)
- [ ] Stir and soak again
- [ ] Hand test for heat (all areas cool)
- [ ] Scatter cold ashes
- [ ] Check area before leaving

**Wildfire Risk:** If conditions are hot, dry, and windy - DO NOT start a fire. Use stove or eat cold food.

## 🔥 Friction Fire Troubleshooting

**Common Bow Drill Failures:**
- ❌ Wood too wet (>15% moisture) → Find standing dead wood
- ❌ Spindle wobbles → Straighten spindle, adjust bow tension
- ❌ String slips → Roughen spindle, tighten bow
- ❌ Not enough pressure → Lean weight into handhold
- ❌ Stopping too soon → Continue 10 seconds after smoke
- ❌ Wrong wood type → Use softwood (cedar, willow, cottonwood)

**Hand Drill Challenges:**
- Most physically demanding method
- Requires very dry wood (<10% moisture)
- Speed more important than pressure
- Build calluses through practice
- Consider two-person method
- Success rate <40% for beginners
