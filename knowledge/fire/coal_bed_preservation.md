## Coal Bed Preservation

### Overview
Coal bed preservation is a vital survival technique for maintaining embers over extended periods, drastically reducing the effort and resources needed to restart a fire. By carefully burying hot coals, you can keep them smoldering for hours, even overnight, ensuring a readily available heat source or fire-starting capability without constant tending or the need for friction fire methods. This method is crucial for conserving energy and resources in a survival situation.

### Materials Needed
*   **Existing Fire/Coal Bed:** A mature fire that has burned down to a substantial bed of hot, glowing embers. Hardwood coals are ideal.
*   **Ash:** A quantity of fine, dry ash from the existing fire.
*   **Dry Soil or Sand:** Non-combustible, insulative material. Clay-rich soil works well; avoid overly rocky or damp soil.
*   **Digging Tool:** A small shovel, trowel, sturdy stick, or flat rock for excavating and covering.
*   **Heat-Resistant Tools:** Tongs, sticks, or a small shovel for safely moving hot coals.
*   **Water (Optional but Recommended):** A small amount of water nearby for safety in case of accidental spread.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Prepare the Coals (Step 1):** Allow your fire to burn down until you have a concentrated bed of bright, red-hot embers. Use your heat-resistant tools to consolidate the hottest coals into a compact pile, approximately 6-10 inches (15-25 cm) in diameter. The more compact the pile, the better it will retain heat.

2.  **Select and Prepare the Site (Step 2):** Choose a location that is clear of all flammable materials (leaves, grass, roots) for at least a 2-foot (60 cm) radius. Dig a shallow pit, roughly 8-12 inches (20-30 cm) deep and slightly wider than your coal pile, in dry, non-combustible soil.

3.  **Transfer the Coals (Step 3):** Carefully scoop or roll the consolidated pile of hot coals into the center of your prepared pit. Work quickly but precisely to minimize heat loss.

4.  **Apply Ash Layer (Step 4):** Gently cover the entire coal pile with a 1-2 inch (2.5-5 cm) layer of fine, dry ash from your fire. This ash layer acts as a primary barrier, restricting oxygen flow to the coals and aiding in heat retention. Ensure complete coverage.

5.  **Cover with Soil/Sand (Step 5):** Using your digging tool, carefully cover the ash-covered coals with a thick layer of dry soil or sand. Aim for a minimum of 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) of covering material. This layer provides significant insulation and further restricts oxygen, allowing the coals to smolder for many hours. Form a slight mound over the burial site to help shed water.
