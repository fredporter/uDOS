# Splinting Techniques

**Category:** Medical
**Difficulty:** Moderate

### Overview

Fractures (broken bones) and dislocations (bones out of joint) are common injuries in survival scenarios, often resulting from falls, impacts, or missteps in rugged terrain. Such injuries are not only intensely painful but can also lead to further damage if the injured limb or joint is not stabilized. Movement of a broken bone can sever blood vessels, damage nerves, or turn a closed fracture into a more dangerous open (compound) fracture.

Splinting is the process of immobilizing an injured body part to prevent further movement and reduce pain. In a survival situation where professional medical help may be hours or days away, a properly applied splint can be a life-saving skill. It helps to prevent additional injury, lessen bleeding and swelling, and facilitate safer transport of the injured individual. This guide will provide practical, step-by-step instructions for improvising and applying splints using materials commonly found in a wilderness or disaster environment.

### Materials Needed

*   **Rigid Splint Material:**
    *   Sticks, branches (straight and sturdy)
    *   Rolled newspapers, magazines, cardboard
    *   Tent poles, trekking poles, ski poles
    *   Flat pieces of wood or bark
    *   Any sturdy, relatively lightweight object that won't flex easily.
*   **Padding Material:**
    *   Bandages, gauze rolls
    *   Clean cloth (t-shirts, towels, bandanas)
    *   Moss, dry leaves, grass (packed tightly and free of debris)
    *   Socks, spare clothing
    *   Anything soft that can cushion the limb.
*   **Binding Material:**
    *   Rope, cordage, paracord
    *   Shoelaces, belt
    *   Strips of cloth (torn from clothing)
    *   Duct tape, electrical tape, medical tape
    *   Elastic bandages (if available in a first-aid kit).
*   **Cutting Tool:** Knife or scissors (to cut binding or splint material).
*   **Gloves:** Disposable medical gloves (if available, for hygiene and to protect against bloodborne pathogens).
*   **Sling Material (for arm injuries):** Large bandana, triangular bandage, piece of cloth.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Assess the Situation and Ensure Safety:**
    *   Before approaching, ensure the scene is safe for you and the victim. Remove any immediate dangers.
    *   Check for life-threatening conditions (Airway, Breathing, Circulation - ABCs) first. Treat severe bleeding before splinting.
    *   Reassure the victim and explain what you are doing.

2.  **Expose the Injury and Perform Initial Assessment:**
    *   Gently cut or remove clothing around the injured area to expose the skin. Do not attempt to pull clothing off if it causes pain.
    *   Observe for:
        *   **Deformity:** Obvious unnatural angles or lumps.
        *   **Swelling:** Any puffiness around the area.
        *   **Discoloration:** Bruising or redness.
        *   **Open Wounds:** Puncture or tearing of the skin (indicates an open fracture).
        *   **Patient Response:** Ask where it hurts, if they can move it.
    *   **Check Circulation, Sensation, and Movement (CSM/CMS) BELOW the injury:**
        *   **Circulation:** Check for a pulse (e.g., radial for arm, pedal for leg) or capillary refill (press nail bed, it should return to pink in <2 seconds).
        *   **Sensation:** Ask the victim if they can feel your touch on the limb below the injury.
        *   **Movement:** Ask them to wiggle their fingers or toes *if it causes no pain*.
        *   *Perform this check BEFORE and AFTER splinting.*

3.  **Dress Any Open Wounds:**
    *   If there's an open fracture (bone protruding or visible through a wound), do NOT attempt to push the bone back in.
    *   Cover the wound with a clean, sterile dressing (gauze, clean cloth). Apply direct pressure if bleeding. Splint *over* the dressing.

4.  **Immobilize the Joint Above and Below the Injury:**
    *   A fundamental principle of splinting is to immobilize not just the injured bone, but also the joint immediately above it and the joint immediately below it. This ensures full stabilization.
    *   **Example:** For a broken forearm, the splint should extend from above the elbow to below the wrist.

5.  **Pad All Bony Prominences:**
    *   Use generous amounts of soft padding material (cloth, moss, leaves) to cushion any bony areas that will be in contact with the rigid splint material. This prevents pressure sores, discomfort, and nerve damage. Common areas include wrists, ankles, elbows, knees, and along the spine.

6.  **Apply Rigid Splint Material:**
    *   Position your chosen rigid material (e.g., sticks, rolled newspaper) carefully alongside the injured limb.
    *   If using multiple rigid pieces, place them on opposite sides of the limb (e.g., one on top, one on bottom; or one on each side). Ensure they are long enough to extend beyond the joints above and below the injury.
    *   *Gently* support the injured limb while positioning the splint. Avoid unnecessary movement. If possible, have an assistant support the limb in a comfortable, anatomical position. Do NOT try to realign severely deformed limbs unless absolutely necessary due to compromised circulation and you are specifically trained to do so.

7.  **Secure the Splint with Binding Material:**
    *   Starting from points furthest from the injury and moving inwards, begin to secure the rigid splint material with your binding (rope, cloth strips, tape).
    *   Tie knots (e.g., square knots) that are firm but not overly tight. You should be able to slip a finger under the binding.
    *   Place bindings above and below the injury, and also above and below the joints you are immobilizing. Do not place bindings directly over the injury or directly over bony prominences.
    *   Ensure the splint is snug enough to prevent movement but loose enough not to cut off circulation.

8.  **Re-check Circulation, Sensation, and Movement (CSM/CMS):**
    *   This is a critical step after the splint is applied.
    *   Check for pulse, capillary refill, sensation, and movement (fingers/toes).
    *   **Warning Signs:** Numbness, tingling, increased pain, pale or bluish skin, coldness, or inability to move fingers/toes that were previously mobile indicate the splint is too tight or incorrectly applied. If any of these occur, immediately loosen the splint and re-tie it more carefully. Re-check CSM.

9.  **Support and Elevate:**
    *   **Arm/Wrist/Hand:** Use a sling to support the arm, keeping the hand higher than the elbow to reduce swelling. A swathe (another bandage around the torso) can secure the arm to the body for further immobilization.
    *   **Leg/Ankle/Foot:** Keep the leg elevated if possible (e.g., prop it on a log or backpack) to reduce swelling.
    *   **Ice (if available):** Apply cold packs wrapped in cloth to reduce swelling and pain, but do not apply ice directly to skin.

### Specific Splinting Techniques

*   **Forearm/Wrist:**
    *   Use two rigid splints: one along the palm side and one along the back of the forearm, extending from above the elbow to past the fingertips.
    *   Pad thoroughly. Secure with bindings.
    *   Support with a sling, ensuring the hand is slightly elevated.
*   **Upper Arm (Humerus):**
    *   If the fracture is in the middle of the humerus, place a rigid splint along the outside of the arm, extending from the shoulder to the elbow.
    *   Secure it to the arm, then secure the entire arm to the chest with a broad swathe bandage. Use a sling to support the forearm.
*   **Lower Leg/Ankle:**
    *   Use two rigid splints, one on each side of the leg, extending from above the knee to beyond the foot.
    *   Pad well, especially around the ankle and knee.
    *   Secure with bindings in multiple places, ensuring the ankle is stabilized at a 90-degree angle.
*   **Thigh/Femur:**
    *   This is a serious injury with high risk of shock. Minimal movement is paramount.
    *   The best improvisation is often a **body splint**: place generous padding between the injured leg and the uninjured leg. Secure the injured leg to the uninjured leg with multiple bindings (at the ankles, below and above the knee, and at the thigh). The uninjured leg acts as a natural rigid splint.
    *   Extend bindings to immobilize the hip and ankle joints.
*   **Finger/Toe:**
    *   **Buddy Taping:** For minor sprains or fractures, tape the injured finger/toe to an adjacent, uninjured one using medical tape or strips of cloth. Place padding (e.g., cotton, gauze) between the digits to prevent skin irritation.
    *   **Small Rigid Splint:** For a more stable finger fracture, a small stick, tongue depressor, or stiff cardboard can be used as a splint, taped to the finger with padding.
*   **Clavicle (Collarbone)/Shoulder:**
    *   A simple sling and swathe is typically sufficient. The sling supports the arm, and the swathe holds the arm snugly against the body, immobilizing the shoulder.

### Safety Considerations

*   **Do Not Attempt to Realign:** Unless trained in wilderness medicine and facing a severe circulation compromise, never attempt to 'set' a bone or reduce a dislocation. You could cause further damage to nerves, blood vessels, or surrounding tissues.
*   **Spinal/Head Injuries:** If a head, neck, or spinal injury is suspected (e.g., from a fall, diving accident, direct trauma to the head/back), do NOT move the victim unless absolutely necessary to remove them from immediate danger (e.g., a burning vehicle). Maintain manual in-line stabilization of the head and neck until professional help arrives. Splinting should be a low priority compared to maintaining an open airway and ensuring spinal precautions.
*   **Open Fractures:** Always cover open wounds before splinting. Do not push bone fragments back into the wound.
*   **Check CSM/CMS Repeatedly:** Monitor for signs of compromised circulation or nerve function after splinting and regularly thereafter.
*   **Pain Management:** Splinting should reduce pain. If pain increases significantly after splinting, reassess. Administer over-the-counter pain relievers if the victim is conscious, able to swallow, and has no contraindications.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Protect the victim from hypothermia or hyperthermia while immobilized.

### Common Mistakes

*   **Splinting Too Loose or Too Tight:** Too loose, and it won't immobilize. Too tight, and it cuts off circulation or damages nerves.
*   **Not Immobilizing Joints Above and Below:** This leaves the injured area vulnerable to movement.
*   **Forgetting to Pad Bony Prominences:** Leads to pressure sores, discomfort, and potential skin breakdown.
*   **Trying to Reduce a Fracture/Dislocation:** This often causes more harm than good in untrained hands.
*   **Failing to Dress Open Wounds:** Increases risk of infection.
*   **Not Checking CSM/CMS Before and After:** Misses critical signs of neurovascular compromise.
*   **Moving a Victim with Suspected Spinal Injury Unnecessarily:** Can lead to permanent paralysis or death.
*   **Using Insufficiently Rigid Material:** A flimsy splint is ineffective.
