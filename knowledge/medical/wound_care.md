# Wound Care

**Category:** medical
**Difficulty:** intermediate
**Generated:** 2025-11-27

## Overview

Proper wound care in survival situations prevents infection, controls bleeding, and promotes healing when professional medical help is unavailable. This guide covers assessment, cleaning, dressing, and monitoring techniques for cuts, lacerations, punctures, and abrasions using improvised materials and basic first aid supplies.

## Materials Needed

**Ideal Supplies:**
- Clean water (boiled/purified)
- Soap or antiseptic
- Clean cloth/bandages
- Medical tape or cordage
- Tweezers (for debris removal)
- Antibacterial ointment (if available)

**Improvised Alternatives:**
- Boiled water (cooled)
- Clean clothing strips
- Plant fibers for securing dressings
- Pine resin (antiseptic properties)
- Honey (natural antibacterial)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Stop the Bleeding

**Direct Pressure:**
1. Apply clean cloth directly to wound
2. Press firmly for 5-10 minutes
3. Do NOT remove cloth to check (disrupts clotting)
4. Add more cloth if blood soaks through
5. Elevate wound above heart if possible

**Pressure Points:**
- If direct pressure fails, compress artery between wound and heart
- Arm: Inside of upper arm (brachial artery)
- Leg: Groin crease (femoral artery)

### 2. Clean the Wound

1. **Wash hands** thoroughly (soap and clean water)
2. **Rinse wound** with clean water (flow away from wound)
3. **Remove debris** with clean tweezers (sterilize with flame/alcohol first)
4. **Gently clean** around wound with soap and water
5. **Do NOT** scrub inside wound (damages tissue)
6. **Pat dry** with clean cloth

### 3. Dress the Wound

**For minor wounds:**
1. Apply thin layer of antibiotic ointment (if available)
2. Cover with sterile gauze or clean cloth
3. Secure with tape or strips of cloth
4. Change dressing daily or when wet/dirty

**For larger wounds:**
1. Pack wound lightly with clean gauze
2. Apply bulky dressing over packing
3. Wrap with bandage to secure (not too tight)
4. Check circulation beyond wound (warmth, color)

### 4. Monitor for Infection

**Check daily for:**
- Increased redness/warmth
- Swelling
- Pus or foul-smelling discharge
- Red streaks from wound (blood poisoning)
- Fever

## Safety Considerations

**When to Seek Help:**
- Deep wounds (muscle/bone visible)
- Wounds with embedded objects (do NOT remove)
- Animal/human bites (high infection risk)
- Signs of infection developing
- Inability to stop bleeding

**Critical Warnings:**
- Tourniquets only for life-threatening bleeding (last resort)
- Do NOT use alcohol/hydrogen peroxide inside wounds (damages tissue)
- Deep puncture wounds need professional care (tetanus risk)
- Chest/abdomen wounds require immediate evacuation

**Infection Prevention:**
- Keep wound dry between cleanings
- Change dressings regularly
- Wash hands before every dressing change
- Use cleanest water available

## Tips & Troubleshooting

**Common Mistakes:**
- Removing scab (disrupts healing)
- Over-tightening bandages (cuts circulation)
- Using dirty water/materials
- Not changing dressings often enough

**Improvised Wound Care:**
- Sphagnum moss: Natural absorbent, mild antiseptic
- Clean boiled clothing: Better than dirty store-bought bandages
- Duct tape: Can close small clean cuts (butterfly technique)
- Super glue: Medical-grade for wound closure exists; regular glue NOT recommended

**Natural Antiseptics:**
- Honey: Antibacterial, promotes healing
- Garlic: Crush for antibiotic properties
- Yarrow: Stops bleeding, antiseptic
- Pine resin: Seal and protect wounds

**Signs of Proper Healing:**
- Decreasing redness/swelling
- Wound edges pulling together
- No discharge or odor
- New pink tissue forming
