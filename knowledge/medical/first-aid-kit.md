## Snake Bite First Aid (Australia Essential)

**Critical for any outdoor kit:**

### What You Need

```
├─ Wide crepe/elastic bandages (10cm width minimum)
│   ├─ 2 bandages minimum (one for bite site, one for limb)
│   ├─ 4 bandages better (full coverage)
│   └─ MUST be wide (5cm too narrow for compression)
├─ Marker pen (mark bite site, time)
└─ Knowledge of pressure immobilization technique
```

### Pressure Immobilization Technique

**Quick reference to include in kit:**

```
1. Keep victim still and calm
2. Apply broad pressure bandage over bite site
3. Bandage entire limb (start at fingers/toes, work up)
4. Firm (like sprain), not tourniquet (should slip finger under)
5. Mark bite site with pen (X)
6. Immobilize limb with splint/sling
7. Keep victim still
8. Call 000
```

**Why wide bandages matter:**
- Narrow bandages = tourniquet effect (dangerous)
- Wide bandages = even pressure (correct)
- 10cm width = safe and effective

**Don't:**
- ✗ Cut bite site
- ✗ Suck out venom
- ✗ Wash bite area
- ✗ Apply ice
- ✗ Use tourniquet

## Cost & Budgeting

### Budget Options

**Pre-made kits:**
- Basic home kit: $30-60
- Vehicle kit: $50-100
- Bushwalking kit: $40-80
- Comprehensive home kit: $100-150

**DIY Assembly:**
- Often cheaper
- Customized to needs
- Better quality individual items possible
- Takes more time/research

**Where to buy:**
```
├─ Pharmacy (good for medications, some supplies)

├─ Hardware stores (some items cheaper in bulk)
├─ Camping stores (wilderness-specific items)
├─ Online (compare prices, bulk items)
└─ Medical supply stores (professional quality)
```

### Cost-Saving Tips

```
├─ Buy basics in bulk (adhesive bandages, gauze)
├─ Generic medications (same as brand name, cheaper)
├─ Start with essentials, add over time
├─ Share group kit for bushwalking (split cost)
├─ Restock individually as used (spread cost)
└─ Compare prices (pharmacy vs hardware vs online)
```

### Priority Spending

**If budget limited, prioritize:**

1. **Wound care** (gauze, bandages, tape, antiseptic)
2. **Tools** (scissors, tweezers, gloves)
3. **Pain relief** (paracetamol, ibuprofen)
4. **Snake bite bandages** (Australia-specific, critical)
5. **Space blanket** (cheap, can save life)
6. **First aid guide** (knowledge = power)

Then add as budget allows.
