# Snake Bites

**Category:** medical
**Difficulty:** intermediate
**Generated:** 2025-11-27

## Overview

Snake bites are serious wilderness medical emergencies requiring immediate, informed action. While most snakes are non-venomous, venomous bites can be life-threatening without proper treatment. This guide covers identification, first aid protocols, venom management, and evacuation procedures for snake bite scenarios in survival situations.

## Materials Needed

**Ideal Supplies:**
- Sterile gauze/dressings
- Elastic bandage (for pressure immobilization)
- Marker pen (to mark venom progression)
- Clean water
- Cell phone/satellite communicator
- First aid manual

**Improvised Alternatives:**
- Clean cloth strips
- Cordage/strips for immobilization
- Charcoal from fire (marks progression)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Immediate Response (First 60 Seconds)

1. **Get away from snake** (prevent second bite)
2. **Stay calm** - panic increases heart rate, spreads venom faster
3. **Remove jewelry/tight clothing** near bite (swelling occurs)
4. **Note time of bite** (critical for medical treatment)
5. **Observe snake safely** (for identification - do NOT pursue/kill)

### 2. Assess the Bite

**Venomous Bite Indicators:**
- Two puncture marks (fangs)
- Immediate severe pain
- Rapid swelling
- Discoloration/bruising
- Nausea/vomiting
- Difficulty breathing

**Non-Venomous Bite:**
- Teeth marks (no fangs)
- Minimal pain
- Little/no swelling
- Treat as puncture wound

### 3. First Aid Protocol

**DO:**
1. Keep victim calm and still (slows venom spread)
2. Position bite below heart level
3. Gently clean wound with soap/water
4. Apply loose, clean dressing
5. Immobilize bitten limb (splint if possible)
6. Mark edge of swelling with time noted
7. Monitor vital signs (breathing, pulse)
8. Evacuate to medical facility IMMEDIATELY

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Cut the wound
- ❌ Suck out venom
- ❌ Apply tourniquet
- ❌ Apply ice
- ❌ Give alcohol/caffeine
- ❌ Let victim walk (if avoidable)
- ❌ Waste time trying to catch snake

### 4. Pressure Immobilization (Specific Venoms)

**For neurotoxic snakes (cobras, coral snakes, some Australian snakes):**
1. Apply firm pressure bandage over bite
2. Wrap entire limb (start at bite, work toward heart)
3. Firm but not circulation-cutting (check pulse)
4. Splint limb to prevent movement
5. Keep victim completely still

**NOT for hemotoxic snakes (rattlesnakes, copperheads, cottonmouths)** - can worsen tissue damage

### 5. Evacuation

- Call emergency services immediately
- Carry victim if possible (avoid walking)
- Keep bitten area immobile
- Continue monitoring vital signs
- Provide snake description to medical personnel
- Note time of bite and symptom progression

  Snake Bite First Aid
  
  1. Assess Bite:
     Venomous = 2 fangs
     • •  ← Punctures
     
  2. Immobilize:
     ┌─────────────┐
     │  ═══════════ │ ← Splint
     │    \u2022 •       │ ← Bite
     │  ═══════════ │
     └─────────────┘
     Keep below heart
     
  3. Mark Swelling:
     
      12:00 →  • •
      12:15 →  ●   ● 
      12:30 →  ◉     ◉
      
  DO NOT: Cut, suck, ice, tourniquet
```

## Safety Considerations

**Critical Warnings:**
- All snake bites require medical evaluation
- Venom effects can be delayed (some species)
- "Dry bites" (no venom) still risk infection
- Never attempt to handle/kill snake for ID
- Children/elderly at higher risk from venom

**Environmental Precautions:**
- Watch where you step/reach
- Wear boots and long pants in snake country
- Use stick to move debris before reaching
- Never put hands where you can't see
- Shake out shoes/sleeping bags

**Common Snake Habitats:**
- Rocky outcrops
- Woodpiles/debris
- Tall grass
- Near water sources
- Under logs/rocks
- Sunny spots for basking

## Tips & Troubleshooting

**Common Mistakes:**
- Trying to catch/photograph snake (risk second bite)
- Applying folk remedies (cutting, sucking, electric shock)
- Using ice (causes tissue damage)
- Tourniquets (can cause limb loss)
- Delaying evacuation to "monitor" symptoms

**Snake Identification (If Safe):**
- Note color pattern
- Head shape (triangular = often venomous in North America)
- Eye pupils (slits vs round)
- Tail characteristics (rattle on rattlesnakes)
- Take photo from safe distance if possible

**Symptoms to Monitor:**
- Swelling progression (mark edges with time)
- Breathing difficulty (airway swelling)
- Bleeding from bite or other sites
- Muscle weakness/paralysis
- Vision changes
- Severe pain

**Treatment Timeline:**
- Antivenom most effective within 4 hours
- Some effects reversible up to 24 hours
- Tissue damage can be permanent
- Time to medical care = critical factor

**Prevent Ion Strategies:**
- Stay on clear trails
- Use trekking poles to probe ahead
- Make noise when hiking (snakes avoid vibrations)
- Never step over logs (step ON, then down)
- Camp away from rock piles/woodpiles
- Use headlamp at night

**Regional Considerations:**
- North America: Rattlesnakes, copperheads, cottonmouths, coral snakes
- Australia: Most venomous snakes globally (pressure immobilization standard)
- Asia: Cobras, kraits (neurotoxic - pressure immobilization)
- Africa: Various vipers, mambas (rapid onset)

**If Alone When Bitten:**
1. Stay calm (critical - reduces venom spread)
2. Self-immobilize bitten limb
3. Move slowly toward help
4. Use emergency communication device
5. Rest frequently to slow circulation
6. Mark your location for rescuers
