# Nutrition Planning for Survival

## Overview
Effective nutrition planning is paramount for long-term survival, providing the essential energy, physical strength, and mental clarity needed to overcome challenges. This guide outlines a practical approach to securing and managing food resources, ensuring sustained well-being in a survival scenario. Planning encompasses everything from immediate stockpiling to long-term self-sufficiency.

## Materials Needed
*   **Non-Perishable Food Items:** Canned goods (vegetables, fruits, meats), dried goods (rice, beans, pasta, oats), MREs (Meals Ready-to-Eat), freeze-dried foods, dried fruits, nuts, seeds, cooking oils, salt, sugar, honey, spices.
*   **Water Purification Supplies:** Water filter (e.g., Sawyer Squeeze, Lifestraw), purification tablets (e.g., iodine, chlorine dioxide), large pots for boiling.
*   **Cooking & Fire Starting Gear:** Durable cooking pot(s), frying pan, fire starter (ferro rod, waterproof matches, lighter), tinder, fuel source (firewood, fuel tablets).
*   **Food Storage Containers:** Airtight bins, Mylar bags with oxygen absorbers, heavy-duty plastic buckets with gamma lids to protect against pests and moisture.
*   **Basic Tools for Procurement (Optional/Advanced):** Fishing line and hooks, small game traps, slingshot, basic gardening tools, heirloom seeds.
*   **Nutritional Supplements:** Multivitamins, specific mineral supplements (e.g., iodine tablets).
*   **Reference Materials:** Local foraging guide, first-aid manual, notebook and pen for inventory.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Assess Your Needs:**
    *   **Determine Duration:** Short-term (days-weeks), mid-term (weeks-months), or long-term (months-years) survival.
    *   **Calculate Caloric Requirements:** A moderately active adult typically needs 2000-2500 calories per day. Children, pregnant/nursing individuals, and those performing strenuous labor require more. Multiply this by the number of people and planned duration.
    *   **Consider Dietary Restrictions:** Account for allergies, medical conditions (e.g., diabetes), or specific dietary needs.

2.  **Prioritize Water:**
    *   Before focusing solely on food, ensure a reliable source of potable water. You can survive weeks without food, but only days without water.
    *   Plan for at least 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water per person per day for drinking and basic hygiene.
    *   Include methods for purification: boiling, chemical treatment, and filtration.

3.  **Stockpile Non-Perishable Foods (Short-to-Mid Term):**
    *   **High-Calorie, Nutrient-Dense:** Focus on foods that provide maximum calories and nutrition for their weight and volume. Examples: rice, beans, lentils, pasta, oats, peanut butter, dried meats (jerky), canned goods, cooking oils (coconut, olive).
    *   **Variety:** Include sources of carbohydrates (grains), proteins (legumes, canned meats), and fats (oils, nuts) to ensure balanced nutrition.
