# Composting Basics

**Category**: Food Production
**Difficulty**: Beginner
**Time Required**: 2-12 months (method dependent)
**Materials**: Organic waste, carbon, nitrogen
**Season**: Year-round (slower in winter)

## Overview

Composting transforms kitchen scraps and yard waste into nutrient-rich soil amendment. Reduces waste, improves soil, grows better food. Simple process that works with or against you depending on conditions.

## How Composting Works

**Decomposition Process**:
- Microorganisms (bacteria, fungi) eat organic matter
- Break down into simpler compounds
- Release heat, CO₂, water
- End result: humus (stable organic matter)

**What Microbes Need**:
1. **Carbon** (energy) - "Browns"
2. **Nitrogen** (protein) - "Greens"
3. **Oxygen** (aerobic decomposition)
4. **Moisture** (60% - like wrung-out sponge)
5. **Temperature** (optimal 57-71°C for hot composting)

## The Carbon-Nitrogen Ratio (C:N)

**Ideal Ratio**: 25-30:1 (carbon to nitrogen)

### "Browns" (High Carbon)

**Examples**:
- Dry leaves
- Straw/hay
- Sawdust (untreated wood)
- Shredded paper/cardboard
- Corn stalks
- Wood chips
- Pine needles

**Characteristics**:
- Dry
- Brown/tan color
- Provide structure (air pockets)
- Slow to decompose alone

### "Greens" (High Nitrogen)

**Examples**:
- Grass clippings (fresh)
- Kitchen scraps (fruit, vegetables)
- Coffee grounds
- Fresh plant trimmings
- Manure (herbivore)
- Seaweed/kelp

**Characteristics**:
- Moist
- Green color (usually)
- Decompose quickly
- Can smell if alone (anaerobic)

### Balancing the Mix

**Rule of Thumb**:
- **By volume**: 3 parts browns : 1 part greens
- **By weight**: 1 part browns : 1 part greens (browns are lighter)

**Signs of Imbalance**:

**Too Much Nitrogen** (excess greens):
- Ammonia smell
- Slimy texture
- Slow decomposition
- Fix: Add browns

**Too Much Carbon** (excess browns):
- Very slow decomposition
- Pile stays cool
- Fix: Add greens

## What to Compost

### YES (Good to Compost)

**Kitchen Scraps**:
- Fruit scraps, peels
- Vegetable scraps, peels
- Coffee grounds + filters
- Tea bags (remove staples)
- Crushed eggshells
- Nutshells (crush first - slow)

**Yard Waste**:
- Grass clippings (thin layers)
- Leaves
- Plant trimmings
- Weeds (before seed)
- Straw/hay
- Wood chips (small)

**Other**:
- Shredded paper (plain, no glossy)
- Cardboard (shredded, no tape/labels)
- Sawdust (untreated wood)
- Herbivore manure (chicken, rabbit, cow, horse)

### NO (Do Not Compost)

**Meat & Dairy**:
- Meat, bones, fat
- Dairy products
- Fish
- Reason: Attracts pests, smells

**Fats & Oils**:
- Cooking oil
- Grease
- Salad dressing
- Reason: Slows decomposition, attracts pests

**Pet Waste**:
- Dog/cat feces
- Litter
- Reason: Pathogens (human disease risk)

**Diseased Plants**:
- Blight-infected tomatoes
- Powdery mildew plants
- Reason: May not kill pathogens (spread disease)

**Treated Wood**:
- Pressure-treated lumber
- Painted/stained wood
- Reason: Toxic chemicals

**Weeds with Seeds**:
- Unless hot composting (kills seeds)
- Reason: Spreads weeds

**Problematic**:
- Glossy paper (chemicals)
- Colored paper (ink)
- Coal/charcoal ash (toxins)
- Synthetic materials

## Composting Methods

### Hot Composting (Fast)

**Timeline**: 2-3 months

**Process**:
1. **Build pile all at once** (minimum 1m×1m×1m)
2. **Layer or mix** greens and browns (proper C:N ratio)
3. **Moisture** to 60% (damp sponge)
4. **Monitor temperature**:
   - Should heat to 57-71°C in days
   - Kills weed seeds, pathogens
5. **Turn pile** when temp drops (every 3-7 days):
   - Mixes material
   - Adds oxygen
   - Restarts heating
6. **Repeat** 3-5 turnings
7. **Finish** when temperature stays ambient, dark and crumbly

**Pros**:
- Fast
- Kills seeds and pathogens
- Well-decomposed product

**Cons**:
- Requires effort (turning)
- Need large volume at once
- More management

### Cold Composting (Slow & Easy)

**Timeline**: 6-12 months (or more)

**Process**:
1. **Add materials as available**
2. **Layer or mix** browns and greens
3. **Keep moist**
4. **Wait**
5. **Harvest from bottom** when ready

**Pros**:
- Easy (no turning)
- Add as you go
- Low effort

**Cons**:
- Slow
- Doesn't kill weed seeds
- May have uncomposted chunks

### Vermicomposting (Worm Bins)

**Timeline**: 2-4 months

**Process**:
1. **Bin setup** (plastic tote, wood box, commercial)
2. **Bedding** (shredded paper, cardboard)
3. **Add red wigglers** (Eisenia fetida)
4. **Feed kitchen scraps** (bury in bedding)
5. **Maintain moisture**
6. **Harvest castings** (worm poop = compost)

**Pros**:
- Indoors or outdoors
- Handles kitchen scraps well
- Castings are excellent fertilizer
- No turning
- Compact

**Cons**:
- Buy worms initially
- Limited capacity
- More sensitive (temp, moisture, pH)
- Some foods to avoid (citrus, onion in excess)

### Trench Composting

**Process**:
1. **Dig trench** in garden (12" deep)
2. **Add kitchen scraps**
3. **Cover with soil**
4. **Plant over it** next season

**Pros**:
- No bin needed
- Direct soil improvement
- Easy

**Cons**:
- Slow
- Takes garden space
- May attract digging animals

## Building a Compost Bin

### Simple Wire Bin

**Materials**: 10-12 feet of wire fencing (3-4 ft tall)

**Steps**:
1. Form cylinder (3-4 ft diameter)
2. Secure with wire ties
3. Fill with materials

**Pros**: Cheap, easy, good airflow
**Cons**: Open (animals, aesthetics)

### Pallet Bin

**Materials**: 3-4 wooden pallets

**Steps**:
1. Stand pallets on edge forming square
2. Secure corners with wire/screws
3. Optional: Add removable front for access

**Pros**: Free/cheap, good size
**Cons**: Wood rots eventually

### Three-Bin System

**Concept**: Turning system
- Bin 1: Active, adding fresh
- Bin 2: Cooking (middle stage)
- Bin 3: Finished, curing

**Benefits**: Continuous production, organized

### Tumbler

**Commercial product**: Rotating drum on frame

**Pros**:
- Easy turning (crank handle)
- Rodent-proof
- Fast
- Clean look

**Cons**:
- Expensive ($100-400)
- Limited size
- Plastic degrades

### Choose Based On

- **Space**: Small yard = tumbler or worm bin
- **Volume**: Lots of waste = three-bin or large wire
- **Effort**: Low effort = cold pile; High effort = hot pile
- **Budget**: Free = pallet or wire; Money = tumbler
- **Aesthetics**: HOA = tumbler; Rural = anything

## Managing Your Pile

### Moisture

**Test**: Squeeze handful
- **Too dry**: No water drips, crumbly → Add water
- **Just right**: Few drops when squeezed, stays formed → Perfect
- **Too wet**: Water streams out, matted → Add browns, turn

**Adjusting**:
- Dry: Water while turning, cover in rain
- Wet: Turn to aerate, add browns, cover

### Aeration

**Why Important**:
- Aerobic = fast, no smell
- Anaerobic = slow, smells rotten

**Methods**:
- **Turning**: Mix pile with fork/shovel
- **Poking**: Push pole/stake into pile (creates channels)
- **Passive**: Structured materials (straw, wood chips) create air pockets

**Frequency**:
- Hot composting: Every 3-7 days when temp drops
- Cold composting: Every few weeks (or never)

### Temperature

**Hot Composting Phases**:

1. **Mesophilic** (68-113°F):
   - Initial phase
   - Moderate-temp microbes
   - Days 1-3

2. **Thermophilic** (113-160°F):
   - Hot phase
   - Heat-loving microbes
   - Kills pathogens and seeds (140°F+)
   - Days 3-30+

3. **Cooling**:
   - Temp drops (material consumed)
   - Signal to turn (reheats) or finish

4. **Curing** (ambient temp):
   - Maturation
   - Stabilization
   - Weeks to months

**Tools**:
- Compost thermometer (long probe)
- Not essential for cold composting

### Particle Size

**Smaller = Faster**:
- Chop/shred materials when possible
- More surface area for microbes
- Kitchen scraps: Cut large items
- Leaves: Shred or run over with mower
- Cardboard: Tear or shred

**Don't over-do**:
- Some structure needed (air pockets)
- Too fine = compaction, anaerobic

## Troubleshooting

### Pile Smells Bad

**Ammonia smell**:
- Too much nitrogen (greens)
- Fix: Add browns, turn

**Rotten egg smell**:
- Anaerobic (no oxygen)
- Too wet and/or compacted
- Fix: Turn, add browns, aerate

### Pile Not Heating

**Too small**:
- Need minimum 1m×1m×1m (27 cubic ft)
- Fix: Add more material

**Too much carbon**:
- Not enough nitrogen
- Fix: Add greens (grass, food scraps, manure)

**Too dry**:
- Need moisture for microbes
- Fix: Water while turning

### Pests (Flies, Rodents)

**Flies**:
- Exposed food scraps
- Fix: Bury scraps in center, cover with browns

**Rodents**:
- Attracted to food
- Fix: Avoid meat/dairy, bury scraps, enclosed bin

**Raccoons/Dogs**:
- Digging for scraps
- Fix: Secure bin, bury deeper, fence

### Pile Too Wet

**Causes**: Rain, poor drainage, too many greens

**Fixes**:
- Turn to aerate
- Add browns
- Cover pile (tarp, lid)
- Improve drainage (pallets under pile)

### Uncomposted Chunks

**Normal in cold composting**

**Solutions**:
- Screen compost (return chunks to new pile)
- Chop materials smaller initially
- Longer composting time
- Hot composting (more thorough)

## Using Finished Compost

### When Is It Done?

**Signs of Finished Compost**:
- Dark brown/black
- Crumbly texture
- Earthy smell
- Original materials unrecognizable
- Cool temperature (ambient)

**Timing**:
- Hot compost: 2-3 months
- Cold compost: 6-12+ months
- Vermicompost: 2-4 months

**Not Quite Done**:
- Still identifiable pieces (OK, screen out)
- Warm (let cure longer)

### Screening

**Why**: Removes uncomposted bits, uniform texture

**Method**:
1. Build or buy screen (1/2" hardware cloth on frame)
2. Shovel compost onto screen
3. Shake/rub through
4. Return large pieces to active pile

### Applications

**Garden Beds**:
- Mix 1-3" into top soil
- Before planting season
- Or top-dress around plants

**Potting Mix**:
- 20-30% compost
- Mix with peat/coco coir and perlite
- For containers

**Mulch**:
- 2-3" layer around plants
- Suppresses weeds
- Retains moisture
- Feeds as it breaks down

**Compost Tea**:
- Steep compost in water (aerated)
- Liquid fertilizer
- Spray on leaves or soil drench

**Lawn Top-Dressing**:
- Thin layer (1/4")
- Improves soil
- Reduces thatch

## Seasonal Considerations

### Summer

**Challenges**: Dries out fast

**Management**:
- Water more frequently
- Cover pile (reduces evaporation)
- Shade pile if possible

### Winter

**Challenges**: Slows or stops (cold temps)

**Options**:
1. **Keep adding** (it will process in spring)
2. **Insulate pile** (straw bales around sides)
3. **Indoor vermicomposting** (for kitchen scraps)
4. **Accept slowdown** (resume in spring)

**Hot composting can continue** (internal heat maintains activity even when outside freezes)

### Spring/Autumn

**Ideal composting seasons**: Moderate temps, moisture

**Take advantage**:
- Build new piles
- Turn existing piles
- Harvest and use finished compost

## Benefits of Composting

**Environmental**:
- Reduces landfill waste (30-40% of household waste)
- Reduces methane (landfill decomposition)
- Sequesters carbon in soil

**Gardening**:
- Improves soil structure
- Increases water retention
- Adds nutrients (slow-release)
- Feeds beneficial microbes
- Suppresses plant diseases
- Reduces need for chemical fertilizers

**Economic**:
- Free fertilizer
- Reduces trash bills (less garbage)
- Better harvests
- Healthier plants (less replacement)

**Self-Sufficiency**:
- Closed-loop system
- Less dependence on external inputs
- Sustainable

## Common Mistakes

**Not Enough Browns**:
- Most common error
- Pile too wet, smelly
- Keep browns stockpiled

**Too Neat/Tidy**:
- Overly compacted
- Poor airflow
- Fluff it up

**Impatience**:
- Expecting overnight results
- Compost takes time
- Let nature work

**Wrong Materials**:
- Meat, dairy, pet waste
- Creates problems
- Stick to safe lists

**No Monitoring**:
- Pile too dry or wet
- Check periodically
- Adjust as needed

## Starting Small

**Beginner Approach**:
1. Simple bin (wire or pallets)
2. Cold composting (less management)
3. Kitchen scraps + yard waste
4. Keep it moist
5. Wait
6. Learn and expand

**Don't overthink**: Composting happens naturally, you're just optimizing
