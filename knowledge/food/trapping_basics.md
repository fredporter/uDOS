# Trapping Basics

## Overview
Trapping is a fundamental survival skill for acquiring food with minimal energy expenditure. It allows you to procure protein while focusing on other critical tasks like shelter building or water procurement. Understanding basic trap construction and placement can significantly increase your chances of sustained survival in the wilderness.

## Materials Needed
*   **Cordage:** Approximately 3-5 feet (1-1.5 meters) of strong cordage. This can be natural (inner bark fibers, twisted vines, sinew) or artificial (paracord, fishing line, wire).
*   **Cutting Tool:** A sharp knife, flint, obsidian shard, or even a sturdy, sharp-edged rock.
*   **Bait:** Local food sources such as berries, nuts, seeds, insects, meat scraps, or even shiny objects for curious animals.
*   **Sticks/Branches:** Several sturdy sticks, approximately 0.5-1 inch (1.2-2.5 cm) in diameter, for constructing trap mechanisms.
*   **Heavy Object:** A large, flat rock or a heavy log to serve as the killing weight for deadfall traps.
*   **Digging Tool (Optional):** A small stick or your hands for minor ground preparation.

## Step-by-Step Instructions: Figure-4 Deadfall Trap

The Figure-4 Deadfall is a classic, effective trap that uses natural materials and a clever trigger mechanism to drop a heavy weight on an unsuspecting animal.

1.  **Site Selection:** Look for areas with signs of small game activity, such as game trails, tracks, droppings, or natural funnels (e.g., narrow passages between rocks or dense vegetation). Proximity to water sources is often a good indicator.
2.  **Gather Your Materials:**
    *   **Killing Weight:** Find a heavy, flat rock or a sturdy log (at least 20-30 lbs or 9-13 kg for small game like rabbits or squirrels). Ensure it's stable and won't roll easily.
    *   **Trigger Sticks (3):** Collect three strong, straight sticks.
        *   **Vertical Support (S1):** About 8-12 inches (20-30 cm) long, sturdy enough to hold the weight.
        *   **Diagonal Release (S2):** About 6-10 inches (15-25 cm) long.
        *   **Bait Stick (S3):** About 4-8 inches (10-20 cm) long, thin enough to be sensitive.
3.  **Prepare the Trigger Sticks:** Using your cutting tool, carve notches and points on the sticks to allow them to interlock securely but release easily under pressure.
    *   **S1 (Vertical Support):** Carve a flat, stable base and a pointed top that will slot into S2.
    *   **S2 (Diagonal Release):** Carve a notch near one end that will receive the pointed top of S1. Carve a point on the other end that will slot into S3.
    *   **S3 (Bait Stick):** Carve a small, shallow notch or platform at one end to hold the bait. Carve a point on the other end that will receive the pointed end of S2.
4.  **Assemble the Trigger:**
    *   Stand S1 upright.
    *   Attach S2 by slotting

PLACEMENT KEYS:
├─ Game trails (look for tracks, droppings)
├─ Water sources (animals must drink)
├─ Feeding areas (nut trees, berry bushes)
└─ Den entrances (burrows, hollow logs)

⚠️  Check local regulations before trapping
