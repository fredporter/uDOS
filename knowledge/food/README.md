## Overview

Food procurement, preservation, and preparation techniques for wilderness survival, self-sufficiency, and emergency situations. From foraging wild edibles to preserving harvests, these guides cover the complete food cycle.

⚠️ **CRITICAL SAFETY:** Never eat anything you cannot positively identify as safe. Many edible plants have toxic lookalikes. Use multiple identification methods and when in doubt, don't eat it.

## 🎓 Learning Tips

1. **Safety First:** Master toxic plant identification before foraging
2. **Positive ID:** Need 3+ matching characteristics to identify plants
3. **Start Small:** Begin with abundant, easy-to-ID plants (dandelion, clover)
4. **Seasonal:** Learn what's available in each season
5. **Local Focus:** Study plants native to your region
6. **Practice:** Forage with experienced guides first
7. **Test Small:** Try new wild foods in small amounts (allergies, reactions)
8. **Preserve Surplus:** Don't waste - preserve when abundant

## ⚠️ Critical Safety Notes

**Never Eat If:**
- Cannot positively identify (100% certain)
- Milky or discolored sap (except dandelion, milkweed)
- Beans, bulbs, or seeds inside pods (many are toxic)
- Bitter or soapy taste
- Grain heads with pink, purple, or black spurs (ergot fungus)
- Three-leaved growth pattern (poison ivy, etc.)
- Almond scent in woody parts/leaves (cyanide)
- "Carrot-like" leaves by water (water hemlock - deadly)

**Mushroom Rule:** Unless you're 100% certain, don't eat ANY mushroom. Many deadly mushrooms look similar to edible ones.

**Universal Edibility Test:** Last resort only (takes 24+ hours, not reliable for mushrooms)
