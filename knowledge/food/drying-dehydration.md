# Food Preservation: Drying & Dehydration

**Category**: Food Production
**Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate
**Time Required**: Hours to days (method dependent)
**Materials**: Heat source, airflow, storage containers
**Season**: Best in warm, dry conditions

## Overview

Drying is one of the oldest, simplest, and most reliable food preservation methods. Removes moisture that bacteria, mold, and yeast need to grow. Properly dried food lasts months to years.

## How Drying Works

**Principle**: Remove water to below 20% moisture content
- Bacteria need >20% moisture
- Most foods naturally 60-95% water
- Target: 10-20% for storage

**Preservation Factors**:
- Low moisture
- Salt (optional - enhances)
- Smoke (optional - antimicrobial)
- Packaging (prevents rehydration)

## Methods Comparison

| Method | Time | Cost | Efficiency | Best For |
|--------|------|------|------------|----------|
| Sun Drying | 2-4 days | Free | Low | Fruits, low humidity |
| Air Drying | 2-4 weeks | Free | Very Low | Herbs, flowers |
| Oven | 6-12 hrs | Med | Medium | Small batches, testing |
| Dehydrator | 4-12 hrs | High | High | All foods, consistent |
| Solar Dehydrator | 1-3 days | Med | Medium | Off-grid, sunny climate |
| Smoke Drying | 1-3 days | Low | Medium | Meat, fish |

## Sun Drying (Ancient Method)

**Requirements**:
- Hot, dry climate (85°F+, <20% humidity)
- Low pollution
- Several consecutive sunny days
- Bug protection

**Best Foods**:
- Fruits (high sugar/acid)
- Tomatoes
- Hot peppers
- Herbs

**NOT recommended for**: Meat (too slow, bacteria risk)

### Process

**Preparation**:
1. **Slice thin** (1/4 inch or less)
   - Uniform thickness = even drying
2. **Pre-treat** (optional):
   - Dip in lemon juice (prevents browning)
   - Sulfur treatment (commercial approach)
   - Blanch vegetables (better texture)

**Drying**:
1. **Arrange on screens**:
   - Single layer, not touching
   - Window screen, cooling rack, or mesh
   - Avoid metal screening (copper/aluminum react)
   - Food-grade plastic mesh or cheesecloth

2. **Cover with cheesecloth**:
   - Keeps insects off
   - Allows airflow
   - Raised above food (use blocks to support)

3. **Place in full sun**:
   - Direct sunlight
   - Good air circulation
   - Rotate trays if uneven sun

4. **Bring inside at night**:
   - Prevents dew rehydration
   - Store in dry place
   - Return to sun next morning

5. **Test for dryness** (see section below)

6. **Condition** (see section below)

**Time**: 2-4 days depending on food, weather

**Challenges**:
- Weather dependent
- Slow (bacterial growth risk)
- Insect attraction
- Dust/pollution
- Limited seasons (hot, dry only)

## Air Drying (Herbs & Flowers)

**Best for**:
- Herbs (basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary)
- Flowers (lavender, chamomile)
- Hot peppers (whole small ones)

### Hanging Method

1. **Bundle stems** (5-10 stems)
2. **Tie tightly** with string (stems shrink as they dry)
3. **Hang upside down**:
   - Dark, dry, warm location
   - Good airflow
   - Away from direct sun (preserves color/flavor)
   - 15-27°C ideal

4. **Paper bag optional** (for flowers/seeds):
   - Place over hanging bundle
   - Punch holes for airflow
   - Catches falling seeds/petals

**Time**: 1-4 weeks

### Screen Drying

1. **Lay herbs/petals on screen**
2. **Single layer**
3. **Turn daily**
4. **Store when crispy**

**Signs of Dryness**:
- Crumbles easily between fingers
- Crispy, not leathery
- No moisture when crushed
- Stems snap rather than bend

## Oven Drying (Accessible)

**Advantages**:
- Works in any weather
- Faster than sun
- Temperature control
- Bug-free

**Disadvantages**:
- Energy cost
- Can overdry/cook
- Limited capacity
- Requires monitoring

### Process

1. **Prepare food** (slice thin, pre-treat)

2. **Preheat oven to lowest setting**:
   - Ideal: 135-145°F
   - Many ovens: minimum 170°F (too hot but workable)
   - Use oven thermometer to verify

3. **Arrange on racks**:
   - Cookie sheets or cooling racks
   - Parchment paper if small pieces
   - Single layer, space between pieces

4. **Prop door open** (2-6 inches):
   - Allows moisture to escape
   - Necessary for success
   - Use wooden spoon or folded towel

5. **Rotate trays** every 1-2 hours:
   - Even drying
   - Front to back, top to bottom

6. **Check frequently**:
   - Different pieces dry at different rates
   - Remove done pieces
   - Continue drying rest

**Time**: 6-12 hours (depends on food and temp)

**Temperature Guide**:
- Herbs: 95-115°F
- Vegetables: 125-135°F
- Fruits: 135-145°F
- Meat: 145-165°F (safety)

## Electric Dehydrator (Best Option)

**Why Best**:
- Consistent temperature
- Even airflow
- Stackable trays (capacity)
- Energy efficient
- Works in any weather
- Fastest method (except oven)

**Types**:
- **Vertical airflow** (budget): Cheaper, less even drying
- **Horizontal airflow** (better): More expensive, even drying, no flavor mixing

**Popular Brands**: Excalibur, Nesco, Presto

### Process

1. **Prepare food** (slice uniform)

2. **Pre-treat if needed**

3. **Arrange on trays**:
   - Single layer
   - 1/4 inch space between pieces
   - Mesh sheets for small pieces

4. **Set temperature**:
   - Follow food-specific guidelines
   - Herbs: 95-115°F
   - Vegetables: 125°F
   - Fruits: 135°F
   - Meat: 145-165°F

5. **Dry until done** (see testing below)

6. **Rotate trays** (if vertical airflow model)

**Time**: 4-12 hours

## Solar Dehydrator (Off-Grid)

**DIY Construction**:
- Wooden frame
- Glass or clear plastic front (captures heat)
- Black interior (absorbs heat)
- Screened trays
- Vents (bottom and top for airflow)

**Principle**:
- Sun heats interior (greenhouse effect)
- Temperature higher than ambient
- Passive air circulation (hot air rises)

**Performance**:
- 100-140°F internal temp possible
- Faster than sun drying
- Better than sun (heat + airflow)
- No electricity

**Plans available online**: Search "DIY solar food dehydrator"

## Smoke Drying (Meat & Fish)

**Combines**:
- Heat (drying)
- Smoke (antimicrobial compounds)
- Salt (draws moisture, preserves)

**Best for**:
- Fish (especially oily: salmon, mackerel)
- Meat (jerky, strips)
- Not ideal for most vegetables/fruits

### Cold Smoking (below 90°F)

**Purpose**: Flavor + preservation
**Does NOT cook food**
**Requires curing first** (salt cure for days)

**Process**:
1. Salt cure meat/fish (days to weeks)
2. Rinse and dry
3. Smoke at 15-27°C for 12-24 hours
4. Smoke contains preservatives

**Storage**: Continues to require cool, dry storage

### Hot Smoking (140-180°F)

**Purpose**: Cook + flavor + partial drying

**Process**:
1. Brine or dry cure (hours to overnight)
2. Air dry until tacky ("pellicle" forms)
3. Smoke at 165-180°F until cooked
4. Internal temp 145°F+ (safety)
5. Continue low smoke for further drying if making jerky

**Storage**: Less shelf-stable than cold-smoked, but edible immediately

### Smoke Drying for Storage

**Goal**: Fully dried jerky/pemmican

1. Salt cure
2. Hot smoke until cooked (165°F internal)
3. Reduce heat, continue smoking/drying (125-145°F)
4. Dry until brittle or leathery (preference)

**Time**: 4-12 hours total

## Food-Specific Guidelines

### Fruits

**Best Fruits**:
- Apples
- Pears
- Peaches
- Apricots
- Plums
- Berries
- Bananas
- Grapes (raisins)

**Preparation**:
- Peel if desired (faster drying)
- Core, pit
- Slice 1/4 inch thick

**Pre-treatment** (optional but recommended):
- **Lemon juice dip**: Prevents browning
  - 1/4 cup lemon juice per quart water
  - Dip 5 minutes
- **Ascorbic acid**: Same purpose, less flavor impact
- **Blanching**: Breaks down cell walls, faster drying

**Dryness Test**:
- Leathery, pliable
- No moisture when squeezed
- Tears but doesn't snap

**Temperature**: 135-145°F

**Time**: 6-12 hours

### Vegetables

**Best Vegetables**:
- Tomatoes
- Peppers
- Onions
- Carrots
- Mushrooms
- Green beans
- Peas
- Corn
- Zucchini

**Preparation**:
- Wash thoroughly
- Slice thin (1/4 inch or less)
- Uniform size

**Blanching Recommended**:
- Boiling water 3-5 minutes
- Or steam 5-7 minutes
- Ice bath to stop cooking
- Pat dry before dehydrating

**Why blanch**:
- Stops enzyme action (better storage)
- Sets color
- Shortens drying time
- Better texture when rehydrated

**Dryness Test**:
- Brittle or crispy
- Snaps when bent
- No moisture pockets

**Temperature**: 125-135°F

**Time**: 4-10 hours

### Meat (Jerky)

**Meat Selection**:
- Lean cuts (fat goes rancid)
- Beef: Round, sirloin, flank
- Venison, elk (very lean)
- Turkey, chicken (less common)

**Preparation**:
1. **Trim ALL fat**
2. **Slice thin**:
   - 1/4 inch thick
   - With grain = chewy
   - Against grain = tender
   - Partially freeze for easier slicing

3. **Marinate** (4-24 hours):
   - Soy sauce, Worcestershire
   - Salt (critical for preservation)
   - Sugar (flavor, browning)
   - Spices

**Safety**:
- **Heat to 165°F internal** before or during drying (USDA recommendation)
- Option 1: Pre-heat in oven to 165°F, then dry at 145°F
- Option 2: Dry at 165°F for first hour, then reduce
- Kills bacteria (especially E. coli in venison)

**Dryness Test**:
- Bends without breaking (slightly pliable)
- OR brittle if preference
- No moisture droplets

**Temperature**: 145-165°F

**Time**: 4-8 hours

**Storage**: Cool, dry, dark. Lasts months (refrigerate for longer)

### Herbs

**Best Herbs for Drying**:
- Oregano
- Thyme
- Rosemary
- Sage
- Mint
- Basil (gentle heat)
- Dill

**Harvest**:
- Morning after dew dries
- Before flowering (most oils)
- Cut stems, not just leaves

**Method**:
- Air dry (best flavor)
- Dehydrator at 95-115°F (faster)
- Dark location (preserves color)

**Dryness Test**:
- Crumbles easily
- Stems snap

**Storage**:
- Whole leaves (not crushed) for longer life
- Crush when using
- Airtight container, dark, cool

## Testing for Dryness

**Why Critical**:
- Underdried = mold in storage
- Overdried = nutrient loss, poor texture

**General Tests**:

**Fruits**:
- Pliable, leathery
- No moisture droplets when squeezed
- Tears but doesn't break

**Vegetables**:
- Brittle or crispy
- Snaps cleanly
- No soft spots

**Meat**:
- Bends without breaking OR brittle (preference)
- No moisture beads

**Herbs**:
- Crumbles between fingers
- Stems snap

**Universal**:
- Cut piece in half
- No moisture visible in center
- Let cool before testing (warm food feels drier)

## Conditioning (Critical Step)

**Purpose**: Even out remaining moisture, detect under-drying

**Process**:
1. **Cool food completely**
2. **Pack loosely in glass jar** (2/3 full)
3. **Seal jar**
4. **Shake daily for 7-10 days**
5. **Watch for condensation** inside jar
6. **If condensation appears**:
   - Food not dry enough
   - Return to dehydrator
   - Dry more
   - Repeat conditioning

**Why It Works**:
- Moisture redistributes from wetter to drier pieces
- Reveals hidden moisture
- Prevents mold in long-term storage

## Storage

**Containers**:
- Glass jars (best - see moisture)
- Mylar bags with oxygen absorbers (long-term)
- Vacuum-sealed bags
- Plastic containers (OK for short-term)

**Location**:
- Cool (below 60°F best)
- Dark (light degrades)
- Dry (prevent rehydration)

**Oxygen Absorbers**:
- Removes oxygen from sealed container
- Prevents oxidation
- Extends shelf life significantly
- Use with airtight containers/bags

**Shelf Life**:

| Food | Shelf Life (Proper Storage) |
|------|----------------------------|
| Fruits | 6-12 months |
| Vegetables | 6-12 months |
| Jerky | 1-3 months room temp, 6+ months frozen |
| Herbs | 1-2 years |

**With oxygen absorbers in Mylar**: Can extend to years

**Check periodically**: Discard if mold, off smell, or rehydration

## Rehydration

**Fruits/Vegetables**:
1. Cover with water (room temp to hot)
2. Soak 20 minutes to 2 hours
3. Or add directly to cooking liquid

**Ratio**: 1 cup dried ≈ 1-2 cups water

**Meat/Jerky**:
- Eat as-is (dried snack)
- Or simmer in stew/soup (rehydrates while cooking)

## Common Problems & Solutions

**Food Turns Brown**:
- Oxidation during drying
- Prevention: Pre-treat with lemon juice/ascorbic acid
- Dehydrate faster (higher temp/better airflow)

**Mold During/After Drying**:
- Too slow drying
- Too humid
- Not dried enough before storage
- Storage area too moist
- Solution: Faster method, better airflow, condition properly

**Case Hardening**:
- Outside dry, inside still wet
- Caused by too-high temperature
- Prevention: Lower temp, slower dry

**Sticking to Trays**:
- Spray trays with oil
- Use parchment paper
- Turn pieces partway through

## Efficiency Tips

**Harvest at peak**:
- Maximum nutrition
- Best flavor
- Abundant supply (preserve surplus)

**Slice uniform**:
- Even drying
- Batch completion
- Less monitoring

**Run full loads**:
- Energy efficiency
- Amortize time investment

**Multi-task**:
- Rotate trays during other activities
- Overnight drying (dehydrator)
