# Bushcraft Recipes: Wild Forage Stew

## Overview
In a survival situation, a nourishing meal is crucial for morale and energy. This guide details how to create a basic, adaptable wild forage stew using readily available natural resources. Learning to identify, gather, and prepare wild edibles and small game/fish can provide essential sustenance when conventional food sources are unavailable.

## Materials Needed
*   **Water Container:** A durable pot, large metal can, or other fire-safe vessel (e.g., an improvised bark container lined with clay, if absolutely no metal is available).
*   **Fire Source:** Lighter, ferro rod, matches, or a bow drill kit.
*   **Fuel:** Dry firewood, tinder, and kindling.
*   **Cutting Tool:** A sharp knife, flint blade, or other cutting implement.
*   **Foraged Wild Edibles:** Positively identified edible plants (e.g., dandelion leaves/roots, plantain, cattail shoots, wild berries, wild garlic/onions). *Identification is paramount.*
*   **Optional: Small Game/Fish:** If hunting/fishing skills permit (e.g., squirrel, rabbit, fish).
*   **Optional: Salt:** If available. Otherwise, a small amount of clean wood ash can provide trace minerals (use sparingly and with caution).
*   **Stirring Utensil:** A sturdy stick or clean piece of wood.
*   **Water Source:** A reliable source of fresh water (must be boiled).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Site Selection & Fire Preparation:** Choose a safe, sheltered location away from flammable materials for your fire. Gather sufficient firewood, kindling, and tinder.

2.  **Gather & Identify Wild Edibles:** Carefully forage for edible plants in your area. Focus on common, easily identifiable species. Collect roots, shoots, leaves, and berries.
