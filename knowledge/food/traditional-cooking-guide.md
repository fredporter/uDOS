   ├─ 120°C
   ├─ Line tray with baking paper
   └─ Draw 20cm circle on paper

2. Beat egg whites:
   ├─ Electric mixer on high
   ├─ Beat until soft peaks form
   ├─ 3-5 minutes
   └─ Bowl must be grease-free

3. Add sugar:
   ├─ Add gradually (1 tablespoon at a time)
   ├─ Beat well after each addition
   ├─ Beat until stiff, glossy peaks (8-10 min)
   ├─ Rub between fingers - no sugar grains
   └─ Should be thick and shiny

4. Fold:
   ├─ Gently fold in vinegar, cornflour, vanilla
   └─ Just combined

5. Shape:
   ├─ Spoon onto circle
   ├─ Make slightly higher edges (nest shape)
   ├─ Smooth sides
   └─ Slight dip in center

6. Bake:
   ├─ 120°C for 1.5 hours
   ├─ Turn off oven
   ├─ Leave in oven to cool completely (2+ hours)
   └─ Don't open door

7. Top:
   ├─ Whip cream
   ├─ Spread on cooled pavlova
   ├─ Top with fruit
   └─ Serve immediately
```

**Tips:**
- Crispy outside, marshmallow inside = perfect
- Make day before, add cream just before serving
- Humidity makes meringue weep (choose dry day)

## Essential Techniques

### How to Fold

**Purpose:** Incorporate ingredients without losing air

```
1. Use large metal spoon or spatula
2. Cut down through center of mixture
3. Scrape across bottom
4. Bring up side and fold over
5. Rotate bowl quarter turn
6. Repeat until just combined
7. Don't stir in circles (loses air)
```

**When:** Egg whites into batter, flour into sponge

---

### How to Cream Butter & Sugar

**Purpose:** Incorporate air for light texture

```
1. Butter should be room temperature (soft but not melted)
2. Beat butter first 1-2 minutes
3. Add sugar gradually
4. Beat 3-5 minutes
5. Should be pale, fluffy, increased in volume
6. Scrape down sides occasionally
```

**When:** Butter cakes, biscuits

---

### How to Knead Bread

**Purpose:** Develop gluten for structure

```
1. Flour surface lightly
2. Push dough away with heel of hand
3. Fold dough back over itself
4. Turn 90 degrees
5. Repeat 8-10 minutes
6. Should be smooth, elastic, springs back when poked
```

**When:** All yeast breads

---

### How to Tell When Cake is Done

```
Tests (do all):
├─ Springs back when lightly touched
├─ Shrinks slightly from sides of tin
├─ Skewer inserted in center comes out clean
└─ Specified time elapsed
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bread

```
Problem              Cause                    Solution
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Dense, heavy         Not kneaded enough       Knead 10 min
                     Yeast dead               Check yeast first
                     Not risen enough         Warmer spot/longer

Dry, crumbly         Too much flour           Measure accurately
                     Overbaked                Reduce time

Flat, didn't rise    Yeast dead              Use fresh yeast
                     Water too hot            Use warm (not hot)
                     Salt killed yeast        Keep salt/yeast apart
```

### Cakes

```
Problem              Cause                    Solution
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sunk in middle       Oven too hot            Use oven thermometer
                     Underbaked              Test properly
                     Door opened too soon    Wait 30+ min

Dry                  Overbaked               Reduce time
                     Too much flour          Measure accurately

Dense                Overmixed               Fold gently
                     Too much liquid         Measure accurately
```

### Pastry

```
Problem              Cause                    Solution
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tough                Overmixed               Handle minimally
                     Too much water          Add water carefully

Crumbly              Not enough water        Add 1 tsp more
                     Overworked              Rest between rolling

Shrinks              Not rested              Rest 30 min minimum
                     Stretched when lining   Ease into tin
```
