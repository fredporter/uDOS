## Comprehensive Survival Fishing Techniques

### I. Fundamentals & Pre-Fishing Considerations

#### A. Safety and Regulations

**Survival Context:** While survival often means discarding rules, understanding potential dangers and respecting nature even in dire circumstances is paramount. In a true survival situation, your primary goal is sustenance, but be aware of local laws if the situation isn't critical.

1.  **Water Safety:**
    *   **Drowning:** Always assess currents, depth, and potential hazards. Never fish alone if possible.
    *   **Hypothermia:** Especially in cold water or weather. Dress in layers, have a change of clothes, and know the signs.
    *   **Slipping/Falling:** Rocks, muddy banks, and submerged logs are treacherous.
2.  **Wildlife:** Be aware of venomous snakes, snapping turtles, alligators, or other predators in or near the water.
3.  **Self-Injury:** Sharp tools for making spears or hooks, fish spines, and slippery conditions can lead to cuts or punctures.
4.  **Legal Considerations (if not critical survival):** Many fishing methods described (spearing, trapping, hand fishing, set lines) are illegal in regulated waters. Understand your local laws before practicing these skills in non-survival scenarios.

#### B. Location Selection (Reading Water)

Understanding where fish hide and feed is crucial. Look for areas that provide cover, food, or current breaks.

1.  **Structure and Cover:** Fish are ambush predators and seek protection.
    *   **Submerged Logs/Brush Piles:** Excellent hiding spots for various fish.
    *   **Rock Piles/Boulders:** Provide crevices and current breaks.
    *   **Overhanging Vegetation/Trees:** Offer shade, cover, and a source of falling insects.
    *   **Undercut Banks:** Fish hide in these depressions, especially in rivers.
2.  **Current Breaks (Rivers/Streams):** Fish conserve energy by sitting just outside the main current, waiting for food to drift by.
    *   **Eddies:** Circular currents behind obstructions (large rocks, fallen trees).
    *   **Confluence:** Where two streams or rivers meet, creating disturbed water and nutrient flow.
    *   **Behind Boulders/Logs:** Obvious current breaks.
3.  **Depth Changes:**
    *   **Drop-offs/Ledges:** Fish will often patrol these depth transitions.
    *   **Deep Holes:** Provide refuge from predators and temperature changes.
4.  **Food Sources:**
    *   **Riffles (Shallow, Rocky Areas):** Often rich in insect larvae, attracting smaller fish that larger fish prey on.
    *   **Weed Beds:** Provide cover and habitat for small insects and baitfish.
5.  **Water Clarity:** Clear water allows fish to see you, requiring stealth. Murky water can indicate high runoff or nutrient content, sometimes attracting fish, but makes visual fishing difficult.

#### C. Bait Selection and Preparation

Matching your bait to the local diet of the fish species is key.

1.  **Natural Baits (found almost anywhere):**
    *   **Worms (Earthworms, Nightcrawlers):** Dig in moist soil, under rocks, or leaf litter. Excellent all-around bait.
    *   **Insects & Larvae:**
        *   **Grubs:** Under bark, in rotting wood.
        *   **Crickets/Grasshoppers:** In grassy areas.
        *   **Beetles/Caterpillars:** On plants.
        *   **Maggots:** In carrion (though potentially dangerous to handle).
        *   **Mayfly/Stonefly Nymphs:** Under rocks in streams.
    *   **Small Fish:** If you catch a small baitfish, use it whole or cut into strips for larger predators.
    *   **Frogs/Toads:** Small ones can be effective for larger fish, but often illegal outside survival.
    *   **Crayfish:** Under rocks in streams/lakes. Good for catfish, bass.
    *   **Snails/Slugs:** On moist ground or vegetation.
    *   **Internal Organs:** Small pieces of an animal's liver, heart, or intestines can be very effective.
2.  **Improvised Baits (if available):**
    *   **Bread/Dough:** If you have flour, mix with water to form a sticky dough ball.
    *   **Corn/Peas:** From emergency rations.
    *   **Cheese:** Small pieces.
3.  **Preparation:**
    *   **Chumming:** Throwing small pieces of bait into the water to attract fish to your fishing area. Use sparingly to avoid overfeeding.
    *   **Attaching:** Ensure bait is securely attached to your hook, covering the point.

### II. Active Fishing Techniques

#### A. Hand Fishing / Noodling

**Target Species:** Primarily large catfish, but can be used for other species that hide in cavities.
**Principle:** Luring a fish into a hole or cavity and then manually catching it.

**Technique:**
1.  **Locate Holes:** Look for submerged logs with hollows, undercut banks, rock crevices, or beaver/muskrat dens. Large catfish often rest in these spots during the day.
2.  **Approach:** Move slowly and quietly to avoid spooking the fish.
3.  **Probe the Hole:** Carefully reach your hand into the hole, feeling for a fish. Start with your fingers together to avoid getting stuck.
4.  **Entice the Bite:** Once you feel a fish, gently prod it. Catfish are territorial and will often "mouth" or bite at your hand to defend their space.
5.  **Secure the Grip:** Once the fish bites or you feel its mouth, quickly slide your hand deeper and grab its lower jaw (for catfish). For other fish, a firm grip behind the gills or around the body is needed. Be prepared for a powerful struggle.
6.  **Extract:** Pull the fish out of the hole smoothly and quickly.
7.  **Dangers:** Fish bites (especially catfish with their sandpaper-like teeth), sharp fins (dorsal/pectoral spines), snapping turtles, snakes, or other animals sharing the hole.

#### B. Spear Fishing

**Target Species:** Larger, slower-moving fish, or fish concentrated in shallow water.
**Principle:** Directly impaling fish with a sharp-pointed weapon.

**1. Making Spears:**

*   **Materials:** A straight, sturdy sapling or branch (hardwood like oak, maple, hickory is best), 6-10 feet long, about 1-1.5 inches thick.
*   **Tools:** Knife (if available), sharp stone flake, fire (for hardening).

    *   **a. Single-Point Spear:**
        1.  **Sharpening:** Using your knife or a sharp stone, carve one end of the sapling into a long, tapered point. Make it as sharp as possible.
        2.  **Fire Hardening (Optional but Recommended):** Gently pass the sharpened tip through a fire's flames. Do not let it catch fire; just char it lightly. Scrape off the charred layer, revealing a darker, harder wood underneath. Repeat this process a few times. This removes moisture and hardens the wood, making it more durable.

    *   **b. Multi-Pronged Spear (Gig/Leister):**
        1.  **Preparation:** Select a sapling with one end roughly 1-1.5 inches in diameter.
        2.  **Splitting the Tip:** Using a knife or a wedge and a hammer-stone, split the end of the spear shaft lengthwise into 2, 3, or 4 equal prongs, about 6-12 inches deep.
        3.  **Creating the Spread:** Insert small, sturdy wedges (small stones, pieces of wood) into the base of each split to spread the prongs apart. Aim for a spread of 4-8 inches.
        4.  **Sharpening Prongs:** Carve each prong to a sharp point, similar to the single-point spear. You can also carve small barbs on the inside of each prong to help hold the fish.
        5.  **Binding:** Tightly bind the base of the split (just above where the wedges are inserted) with improvised cordage (inner bark, sinew, strips of cloth) to prevent further splitting and secure the prongs. Wrap it extremely tightly, using a constrictor knot or similar strong binding.
        6.  **Fire Hardening (Optional):** As with the single-point spear, fire harden the tips for increased durability.

**2. Spear Fishing Techniques:**

*   **Stalking:**
    *   **Location:** Shallow, clear water areas (creeks, river edges, lake margins). Look for fish hiding under logs, in weed beds, or along drop-offs.
    *   **Approach:** Move slowly and quietly along the bank or wade cautiously. Look for fish silhouettes or movements.
    *   **Refraction:** Water distorts light, making objects appear shallower than they are. Aim *below* where the fish appears to be, especially if you're spearing from an angle. The deeper the fish, the more you need to compensate.
    *   **The Strike:** When you see a target, take careful aim and strike quickly and powerfully with a downward thrust. Try to pin the fish to the bottom if possible.
*   **Ambush/Wait:**
    *   **Location:** Find a spot overlooking a known fish path, a choke point, or an area where fish congregate (e.g., a natural feeding ground).
    *   **Technique:** Stay absolutely still and hidden. Wait for fish to swim into range. This requires immense patience.
*   **Night Spearing (with light source):**
    *   If you have a torch or lantern, fish are often drawn to the light and can be temporarily disoriented, making them easier targets.
    *   **Caution:** This can also attract predators.

#### C. Improvised Fishing Lines

The goal is to create a functional line, hook, and weight system to present bait to fish.

**1. Improvised Cordage (The Line):**

*   **Materials:**
    *   **Inner Bark:** Basswood, cedar, willow, elm, inner bark of many trees.
        *   **Process:** Peel outer bark, then carefully peel thin strips of the inner fibrous bark. Chew or pound the strips to soften them and separate the fibers. Twist two strands together (each twisted clockwise, then twisted together counter-clockwise – "reverse wrap") to create strong cordage.
    *   **Plant Fibers:** Nettle, yucca, milkweed, dogbane.
        *   **Process:** Strip fibers from stalks/leaves. Scrape or chew to separate and soften. Twist into cordage using the reverse wrap method.
    *   **Sinew:** Tendons from animal carcasses.
        *   **Process:** Dry, then pound and separate into fibers. Twist together. Extremely strong when wet.
    *   **Other:** Dental floss, unwound rope strands, shoelaces, strips of cloth.

**2. Improvised Hooks:**

*   **Materials:** Bone, wood, thorn, shell, metal (if available).
*   **Tools:** Sharp stone flake, knife, abrasive rock.

    *   **a. Gorge Hook:** (Very effective for larger fish)
        1.  **Material:** A small, sturdy piece of bone (fish bone, bird bone), hardwood (hawthorn, oak), or very hard shell, 1-2 inches long.
        2.  **Shape:** Carve it into a thin, double-pointed spindle (like a football shape but more slender), sharp at both ends.
        3.  **Attachment:** Tie your line tightly around the center of the gorge hook.
        4.  **Usage:** Bait the entire gorge hook with a larger bait (worm bundle, small fish). The fish swallows it whole. When the line is pulled, the gorge hook turns sideways and lodges in the fish's throat or stomach.

    *   **b. Thorn Hook:**
        1.  **Material:** A strong, naturally curved thorn from a tree (hawthorn, honey locust, rose bush).
        2.  **Shaping:** Use a knife or sharp stone to sharpen the point and trim the base to a suitable length. You might need to notch the base to help secure the line.
        3.  **Hardening (Optional):** Fire harden for durability.

    *   **c. Bone Hook:**
        1.  **Material:** A flat, sturdy piece of bone (from a larger fish, bird, or small mammal).
        2.  **Shaping:** Use a sharp stone or knife to carefully carve out a J-shaped hook. This is time-consuming and difficult without good tools. Use an abrasive rock to smooth and sharpen the point and barb.

    *   **d. Wooden Hook (Y-Branch or Root):**
        1.  **Material:** A small, strong Y-shaped twig or root, or a piece of wood that can be carved into a hook shape.
        2.  **Shaping:** Carve one arm of the 'Y' into a point and the other into a shank for tying the line. This is less reliable than other methods due to wood flexibility and lack of barb.

    *   **e. Metal Improvised Hooks (if available):**
        1.  **Materials:** Soda can tab, paper clip, safety pin, small nail, thin wire.
        2.  **Shaping:** Bend the metal into a hook shape. Sharpen the point using an abrasive stone or file. A small barb can be created by nicking the inside of the point with a sharp edge.

**3. Improvised Line Setups:**

*   **Handline:** The simplest method. Just a line with a hook and bait, held directly in your hand. Best for active fishing or checking frequently.
*   **Set Line/Trotline:**
    *   **Concept:** A main line stretched across a body of water or along a bank, with multiple baited hooks attached at intervals (snoods).
    *   **Construction:** Secure one end of your main line to a tree or sturdy object on shore. Stretch it across the water (if narrow) or along the bank and secure the other end. Tie shorter lines (snoods) with hooks to the main line every few feet.
    *   **Placement:** Place in productive areas (along drop-offs, weed edges, current breaks). Check frequently.
    *   **Caution:** This method is often illegal and can lead to entanglement of wildlife.

### III. Passive Fishing Techniques

#### A. Traps and Weirs

These methods allow you to focus on other survival tasks while fish are being caught.

**1. Fish Traps (Basket/Bottle Traps):**

*   **Principle:** Luring fish into an enclosure from which they cannot easily escape.
*   **Location:** Shallow, calm water, near cover, or in slow currents.

    *   **a. Woven Basket Trap:**
        1.  **Materials:** Flexible saplings (willow, hazel, young shoots), cordage (for binding).
        2.  **Construction:**
            *   **Frame:** Create a cylindrical or conical frame from sturdy saplings (e.g., 4-6 vertical stakes driven into the ground, bent and tied at the top).
            *   **Weaving:** Weave thinner, flexible saplings or vines horizontally around the frame, creating a tight basket-like structure with small gaps.
            *   **Entrance (Funnel):** Create a separate, smaller funnel-shaped basket. This funnel should be narrower at the opening and wider at its base.
            *   **Assembly:** Insert the narrow end of the funnel into the main basket, securing it so that fish can easily swim in but find it difficult to swim out. The funnel should point towards the inside of the trap.
        3.  **Baiting:** Place bait (crushed berries, insects, meat scraps) inside the trap.
        4.  **Deployment:** Submerge the trap in water, securing it with rocks or by tying it to a bankside anchor. Check regularly.

    *   **b. Improvised Bottle Trap (if plastic bottle available):**
        1.  **Materials:** Large plastic bottle (2-liter soda bottle), knife or sharp tool, cordage.
        2.  **Construction:**
            *   **Cut:** Cut the top third of the bottle off, just below the shoulder.
            *   **Invert:** Invert the cut-off top section and insert it into the bottom section of the bottle, creating a funnel.
            *   **Secure:** Make small holes around the rim of both sections and use cordage to tie them together securely.
            *   **Weighting:** Puncture a few small holes in the bottom of the bottle to allow it to fill with water and sink. Add a few small stones inside for extra weight if needed.
        3.  **Baiting:** Place bait inside the trap before sealing it.
        4.  **Deployment:** Submerge the trap, securing it so it doesn't float away or drift.

**2. Weirs:**

*   **Principle:** Creating a barrier in a stream or river to funnel fish into a collection area or holding pen.
*   **Location:** Shallow, relatively narrow streams or rivers with a consistent flow.
*   **Legality:** Weirs are highly effective but often illegal due to their impact on fish migration. Use only in critical survival.

    *   **Construction:**
        1.  **Materials:** Rocks, logs, branches, stakes.
        2.  **Shape:** Build a V-shaped or W-shaped wall across the stream, with the point of the 'V' facing downstream. The walls should extend from bank to bank and be tall enough to prevent fish from easily swimming over.
        3.  **Collection Point:** At the apex of the 'V', create a narrow opening leading into a small collection chamber or holding pen. This chamber can be a basket trap, a net, or simply a rock-lined pool.
        4.  **Building the Walls:** Use rocks to create a sturdy foundation, then stack logs or interweave branches between stakes driven into the streambed. Ensure there are no large gaps for fish to escape.
        5.  **Function:** Fish swimming downstream will be guided by the weir walls into the collection point. Fish attempting to swim upstream may also be diverted into the trap.
    *   **Maintenance:** Check regularly. The weir can be damaged by strong currents or debris.

### IV. Specialized Techniques

#### A. Ice Fishing Basics

**Extreme Caution:** Ice fishing carries significant risks, primarily falling through the ice and hypothermia. Never go onto ice alone.

1.  **Ice Thickness (Absolute Minimums):**
    *   **2 inches:** NOT SAFE.
    *   **4 inches:** Safe for walking, ice fishing (individual).
    *   **5-7 inches:** Safe for a snowmobile or ATV.
    *   **8-12 inches:** Safe for a small car.
    *   **12-15 inches:** Safe for a medium truck.
    *   **ALWAYS assume ice is unsafe until proven otherwise.** Look for new ice (clear, blue) which is stronger than old ice (cloudy, white). Avoid areas near inlets, outlets, bridges, or aerators where currents can thin ice.
2.  **Making a Hole:**
    *   **Improvised Ice Chisel:** A sturdy pole (spear shaft) with a heavy, sharp stone lashed to the end. Or, a sharpened metal bar if found.
    *   **Technique:** Hold the chisel firmly and strike the ice repeatedly in the same spot. Twist the chisel to break away chunks. Be prepared for a spray of water when you break through. A hole about 6-8 inches in diameter is sufficient.
3.  **Fishing Through the Hole:**
    *   **Line:** A short length of improvised line (dental floss, inner bark cordage) with a small improvised hook.
    *   **Bait:** Small grubs, insect larvae, or small pieces of meat.
    *   **Weight:** A small pebble or nut tied above the hook to get the bait down.
    *   **Jigging:** Lower your bait to a desired depth (often just off the bottom) and gently jig it up and down to attract fish.
    *   **Shelter:** If possible, create a windbreak or small temporary shelter to reduce exposure to cold.
4.  **Dangers:** Hypothermia, frostbite, falling through the ice, getting lost in whiteout conditions.

### V. Post-Catch Management

#### A. Fish Handling and Preparation

Sustainable harvesting and proper preparation are crucial for survival.

1.  **Killing Humanely:**
    *   **Method:** A quick, sharp blow to the head (just above the eyes) with a rock or blunt object. This is more humane and can improve meat quality.
2.  **Cleaning the Fish:**
    *   **Scaling (Optional):** If cooking whole with skin, scrape scales off with the back of a knife, a sharp stick, or a spoon, moving from tail to head.
    *   **Gutting:**
        1.  **Slit Belly:** With a knife or sharp stone, make a shallow cut from the vent (anus) to just under the gills. Be careful not to puncture the intestines.
        2.  **Remove Guts:** Reach into the cavity and pull out all internal organs. Scrape away any bloodline along the backbone.
        3.  **Rinse:** Rinse the cavity thoroughly with clean water.
    *   **Filleting (for larger fish):**
        1.  **Head Cut:** Make a cut behind the gill plate down to the backbone.
        2.  **Along Spine:** Turn the blade and cut horizontally along the backbone to the tail.
        3.  **Skinning:** Lay the fillet skin-side down. Starting from the tail, slide your knife between the skin and the meat, working towards the head.
3.  **Cooking:**
    *   **Roasting/Grilling:** Skewer whole fish or fillets on a stick over an open fire. Cook until flaky.
    *   **Boiling/Steaming:** Wrap in large leaves (dock, burdock, maple) or place in a pot with water.
    *   **Baking (in clay):** Wrap a whole, gutted (but not scaled) fish in wet clay or mud. Place in hot coals. When the clay hardens and cracks, the fish is cooked, and the scales/skin will come off with the clay.
    *   **Smoking/Drying (for preservation):** Cut fish into thin strips, salt (if available), and hang over a slow-burning, smoky fire for extended periods. This dries and cures the meat, preventing spoilage.

### Conclusion

Survival fishing is a skill born of necessity, demanding respect for nature's resources and a keen understanding of aquatic environments. Practice these techniques in a non-survival context (where legal) to build your proficiency. Remember, only take what you need to survive, and always prioritize safety. The ability to procure food from the water can be the difference between failure and survival in the wilderness.
