# Edible Plants Identification

## Overview
Identifying edible plants is a critical survival skill that can provide essential nutrition when other food sources are scarce. Misidentification can lead to severe illness or death, making a cautious and systematic approach absolutely vital. This guide outlines a practical method for testing unknown plants for edibility, prioritizing safety above all else.

## Materials Needed
*   **Sharp Knife or Multitool:** For cutting samples and preparing plants.
*   **Gloves (Optional):** To protect hands from thorns, irritating sap, or rough textures.
*   **Small Container or Bag:** For collecting samples.
*   **Clean Water:** For rinsing and hydration during the testing process.
*   **Notepad and Pencil (Optional):** To record observations and test results.
*   **Watch or Timer:** For accurately timing the Universal Edibility Test phases.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

The **Universal Edibility Test (UET)** is the safest, albeit time-consuming, method to determine if an unknown plant is safe to eat. This process requires patience and strict adherence to each step.

1.  **General Plant Observation & Selection:**
    *   **Avoid Known Toxins:** If you have any knowledge of local poisonous plants, avoid them immediately.
    *   **Look for Red Flags:** Generally avoid plants with:
        *   Milky or discolored sap.
        *   Spines, thorns, or fine hairs that cause irritation.
        *   Bitter or soapy taste.
        *   Almond-like smell (can indicate cyanide).
        *   Shiny leaves or clustered umbrella-shaped flowers (like hemlock).
        *   Red berries (many are toxic).
        *   Fungi/Mushrooms (too risky, avoid completely).
    *   **Select a Single Plant Part:** Choose one specific part (e.g., leaf, stem, root, flower, berry) from a single plant type to test. Do not mix parts or plants.

2.  **Preparation for Testing:**
    *   **Isolate and Separate:** Break off a small section of the chosen plant part. Ensure it's clean and free of insects or dirt.
    *   **No Other Food/Drink:** During the entire UET, consume nothing else except clean water.
