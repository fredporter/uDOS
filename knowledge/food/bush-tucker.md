**Category:** Food & Foraging
**Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
**Priority:** High - Valuable food source
**Caution:** ⚠️ Positive ID essential - many toxic plants


# Bush Tucker: Foraging for Survival

## Overview
Bush tucker refers to any native flora and fauna used for food by indigenous populations, and in a survival situation, it represents vital sustenance. Mastering the art of identifying and safely preparing wild edibles can be the difference between survival and starvation. This guide provides practical steps to safely forage for food in diverse environments.

## Materials Needed
*   **Sharp Knife:** Essential for digging roots, cutting plant material, and preparing small game or insects.
*   **Water Container:** For boiling water, cooking plant matter, and potentially leaching toxins.
*   **Fire Starter:** Lighter, waterproof matches, or ferro rod for cooking, boiling water, and signaling.
*   **Gathering Container:** A sturdy bag, large leaves tied together, or a woven basket to collect edibles.
*   **Basic Field Guide (Optional but Recommended):** A small, waterproof guide specific to your region can aid in identification if carried.
*   **Gloves (Optional):** To protect hands from thorns, irritating plants, or rough surfaces.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Observe and Locate Potential Sources
Begin by observing your surroundings. Look for areas with abundant plant life, especially near water sources, which often support richer ecosystems. Pay attention to signs of animal activity – what are local animals eating? Birds, insects, and mammals often consume edible plants, but be aware that what's safe for an animal may not be safe for a human. Look for root vegetables (often indicated by specific leaf patterns), berries, nuts, and edible insects.

### Step 2: Positive Identification is Key
**NEVER consume anything you cannot positively identify as edible.** When in doubt, leave it out. If you are in a desperate situation and must attempt to identify an unknown food source, follow the **Universal Edibility Test** with extreme caution:

1.  **Selection:** Choose a plant part (leaf, stem, root) that is abundant. Avoid mushrooms at all costs unless you are an absolute expert.
2.  **Contact Test (External):**
    *   Rub a small piece of the plant on your inner forearm or wrist.
    *   Wait 15 minutes. If there's any itching, burning, redness, or swelling, **DO NOT PROCEED.**
3.  **Lip Test:**
    *   If no reaction from the skin test, press a small piece of the plant against your lips.
    *   Wait 15 minutes. If you feel any tingling, burning, or numbness, **DO NOT PROCEED.**
4.  **Tongue Test:**
    *   If no reaction from the lip test, place a small piece on your tongue, holding it there for 15 minutes.
    *   If any unpleasant sensation occurs, **DO NOT PROCEED.**
5.  **Chew Test (Don't Swallow):**
    *   If no reaction, chew a very small amount (e.g., a quarter of a teaspoon) for 15 minutes without swallowing.
    *   If any bitterness, burning, or other negative taste/sensation occurs, **DO NOT PROCEED.**
6.  **Swallow Test:**
    *   If no reaction, swallow the small amount.
    *   Wait **8-12 hours**. During this time, consume nothing else except water. Monitor for any signs of discomfort, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, or diarrhea.
7.  **Consumption:** If after 8-12 hours you feel no ill effects, you can cautiously eat a slightly larger portion (e.g., half a cup) of the plant. Wait another 8-12 hours. If still no symptoms, the plant is likely safe to eat in moderate quantities.

### Step 3: Gathering and Preparation
Once identified, gather edible plants and insects.
*   **Roots:** Dig carefully around the base of the plant with your knife or a sturdy stick.
*   **Berries/Fruits:** Pick ripe ones, avoiding any that look
