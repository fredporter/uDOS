## 1. Drying & Dehydration

Remove moisture to prevent spoilage. Works for fruits, vegetables, herbs, meat.

### Dried Fruit (Apples/Pears)

**Ingredients:**
```
1kg apples or pears
1L water
30g salt (optional, prevents browning)
```

**Method:**
1. Wash and core fruit
2. Slice 5mm thick (uniform thickness)
3. Optional: Soak in salt water (30g salt per 1L) for 10 minutes to prevent browning
4. Arrange on drying racks (single layer, no overlap)
5. Dry until leathery but still pliable (12-48 hours depending on method)

**Drying Methods:**

**Sun drying (hot, dry climates):**
- Place in full sun, cover with muslin to protect from insects
- Bring inside at night (moisture)
- 2-4 days depending on humidity

**Air drying (warm, low humidity):**
- Hang in warm, dry, well-ventilated area
- 3-7 days

**Fire/oven drying:**
- 50-60°C constant temperature
- Door slightly open for moisture escape
- 6-12 hours, check regularly

**Storage:** Airtight container, cool/dark place, 6-12 months

### Dried Herbs

**Method:**
1. Harvest before flowering (highest oils)
2. Wash gently, shake dry
3. Tie in small bundles (5-10 stems)
4. Hang upside down in warm, dark, well-ventilated space
5. Dry 1-2 weeks until brittle
6. Strip leaves, discard stems
7. Store whole or crushed in airtight jars

**Storage:** 12 months in dark jar, cool place

### Jerky (Dried Meat)

**Ingredients:**
```
1kg lean meat (beef, kangaroo, venison)
60g salt
10g black pepper
5g garlic powder (optional)
100ml soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce (optional)
```

**Method:**
1. Trim all fat (fat goes rancid)
2. Slice meat 5mm thick (with grain for chewy, against for tender)
3. Mix salt, pepper, spices
4. Rub into meat thoroughly
5. Optional: Marinate in soy sauce 2-12 hours
6. Arrange on racks, no overlap
7. Dry 50-70°C until dark, brittle, cracks when bent (8-24 hours)
8. Cool completely before storing

**Storage:** Airtight container, 1-2 months room temp, 6 months refrigerated

```

**Method:**
1. **Light cure (2-3 weeks storage):**
   - Layer fish with 300g salt in container
   - Pack salt into cavity and around fish
   - Weight down to compress
   - Drain liquid daily
   - Ready after 24-48 hours
   - Rinse before cooking

2. **Heavy cure (months storage):**
   - Cover completely in 500g salt
   - Pack tightly, weight down
   - Leave 7-10 days
   - Remove, brush off salt
   - Hang in cool, dry, well-ventilated area 2-4 weeks
   - Hard and dry when ready

**To use:** Soak in fresh water 12-24 hours (change water several times), then cook

### Salted Vegetables (Sauerkraut Style)

**Ingredients:**
```
1kg cabbage, shredded
20-30g salt (2-3% of vegetable weight)
Optional: caraway seeds, juniper berries
```

**Method:**
1. Shred cabbage finely
2. Mix with salt in large bowl
3. Massage 5-10 minutes until wilts and releases liquid
4. Pack tightly into jar, press down to submerge in liquid
5. Add more liquid if needed (dissolve 20g salt per 1L water)
6. Weight down to keep submerged
7. Cover loosely (gases escape)
8. Keep at room temperature (18-24°C)
9. Ferments 3-6 weeks (taste to check)
10. Store in cool place or refrigerate

**Storage:** Months in brine, cool place

---

## 3. Pickling

Preserve in acidic solution (vinegar).

### Quick Pickled Vegetables

**Base Brine (pickles 1kg vegetables):**
```
500ml white vinegar (5% acidity minimum)
500ml water
50g salt
100g sugar (adjust to taste)
Spices: 5g mustard seeds, 5g peppercorns, 2 bay leaves, 3 garlic cloves
```

**Method:**
1. **Prepare vegetables:**
   - Wash, cut to size (cucumber spears, onion rings, carrot sticks)
   - Pack into clean jars

2. **Make brine:**
   - Combine vinegar, water, salt, sugar, spices in pot
   - Bring to boil, stir until salt/sugar dissolve
   - Simmer 5 minutes

3. **Fill jars:**
   - Pour hot brine over vegetables
   - Leave 1cm headspace
   - Remove air bubbles (slide knife down sides)
   - Seal with lid

4. **Process:**
   - **For immediate use:** Refrigerate, ready in 24 hours, use within 2 months
   - **For long storage:** Water bath can 10 minutes, cool, store up to 12 months

**Vegetable Prep Times:**
```
Cucumbers:    Slice 5mm, pack raw
Onions:       Slice thin, pack raw
Carrots:      Slice 5mm, blanch 2 min
Beetroot:     Cook until tender, slice, then pickle
Cauliflower:  Break into florets, blanch 2 min
```

## 4. Fermenting

Beneficial bacteria preserve food and add probiotics.

### Basic Fermented Vegetables

**Ingredients:**
```
1kg vegetables (cabbage, carrots, radish, etc.)
20g salt (2% ratio)
Water (if needed)
Optional: spices, herbs, garlic
```

**Method:**
1. Chop vegetables (fine or chunky)
2. Mix with salt, massage until liquid releases
3. Pack into jar, press down firmly
4. Add brine if needed (20g salt per 1L water) to cover vegetables
5. Weight down (keeps vegetables submerged)
6. Cover with cloth or loose lid
7. Ferment at room temperature (18-22°C)
8. Check daily, press down, skim any surface scum
9. Taste after 3 days, ferment 1-4 weeks depending on preference
10. Move to cold storage when done

**Signs of good fermentation:**
- Bubbles
- Cloudy brine
- Tangy smell
- Vegetables soften slightly

**Signs of spoilage (discard):**
- Mold (unless thin white film on surface, can scrape off)
- Slimy texture
- Foul smell

## 5. Smoking

Combines drying with smoke flavor and antimicrobial compounds.

### Hot-Smoked Fish

**Ingredients:**
```
1kg fish fillets
Brine:
  1L water
  80g salt
  40g sugar
  10g black pepper
  2 bay leaves
```

**Method:**
1. **Brine:**
   - Dissolve salt and sugar in water
   - Add spices
   - Submerge fish, refrigerate 2-4 hours
   - Rinse, pat dry
   - Air dry 1 hour (forms pellicle - tacky surface)

2. **Smoke:**
   - Setup smoker (or improvised barrel/box smoker)
   - Use hardwood (never softwood/pine)
   - Hot smoke 60-85°C for 2-4 hours
   - Fish should flake easily, internal temp 63°C
   - Cool completely

**Storage:** Refrigerate up to 1 week, freeze up to 3 months

### Cold-Smoked Meat

**Danger:** Cold smoking preserves but doesn't cook. Risk of botulism. Only with proper equipment and knowledge.

**Safe method:**
- Cure with salt first (7 days)
- Cold smoke 15-30°C for several days
- Dry age 2-4 weeks
- Only for experienced food preservers

## Preservation Safety

### Critical Safety Rules

⚠️ **Botulism Prevention:**
- Use correct salt ratios
- Maintain acidic environment for pickles (pH < 4.6)
- Refrigerate if unsure
- Never seal low-acid foods without pressure canning

⚠️ **Signs of Spoilage - DISCARD IF:**
- Bulging lids
- Mold (except thin white film on ferments)
- Off odors (putrid, rotten)
- Slimy texture
- Gas production in sealed jars

⚠️ **Safe Practices:**
- Clean all equipment thoroughly
- Use fresh, high-quality ingredients
- Follow salt/acid ratios precisely
- Keep ferments submerged in brine
- Store in cool, dark place
- Label with date and contents

### Salt Ratios for Safety

```
╔═══════════════════╦══════════════╦═══════════════╗
║ Preservation Type ║ Salt %       ║ Shelf Life    ║
╠═══════════════════╬══════════════╬═══════════════╣
║ Fermentation      ║ 2-3%         ║ Months        ║
║ Light cure        ║ 8-10%        ║ Weeks         ║
║ Heavy cure        ║ 20-25%       ║ Months-Years  ║
╚═══════════════════╩══════════════╩═══════════════╝
```

**Calculate salt:** For 1kg vegetables, 2% = 20g salt, 3% = 30g salt

## Storage Guidelines

### Ideal Conditions

```
╔═══════════════════╦═══════════════╦═══════════════════╗
║ Food              ║ Temperature   ║ Humidity          ║
╠═══════════════════╬═══════════════╬═══════════════════╣
║ Dried goods       ║ Cool (15-20°C)║ Low (<60%)        ║
║ Ferments          ║ Cold (4-10°C) ║ Any (in brine)    ║
║ Pickles           ║ Cool/room temp║ Any (sealed)      ║
║ Smoked meats      ║ Cold (4-10°C) ║ Moderate (50-60%) ║
╚═══════════════════╩═══════════════╩═══════════════════╝
```

### Container Choices

- **Glass jars:** Best for ferments, pickles (see contents, no reaction)
- **Ceramic crocks:** Traditional fermentation vessels
- **Food-grade plastic:** Ok for short-term, avoid for long ferments
- **Metal:** Only stainless steel (salt corrodes other metals)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dried Foods

**Too brittle:** Over-dried, still safe but less pleasant
**Solution:** Rehydrate before use

**Still soft/moist:** Under-dried, will mold
**Solution:** Continue drying

### Ferments

**Surface mold:** Thin white = kahm yeast (harmless, scrape off)
**Fuzzy color mold:** Discard entire batch

**Too salty:** Used too much salt
**Solution:** Soak in water before eating

**Slimy texture:** Usually spoiled
**Solution:** Discard (unless known slimy ferment like natto)

### Pickles

**Soft/mushy:** Pickled too long or wrong vinegar strength
**Prevention:** Use 5%+ acidity vinegar, don't over-process

**Cloudy brine:** Normal for fermented pickles, spoilage for vinegar pickles
**Action:** Smell and taste test (if vinegar-pickled, may be spoiled)
