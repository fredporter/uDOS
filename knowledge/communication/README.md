## ⚠️ Critical Safety Rules

### Signaling Safety:
- [ ] **Mirror signals** - NEVER aim at aircraft cockpit (pilot blindness)
- [ ] **Signal fires** - Maintain fire safety, have water/extinguisher ready
- [ ] **Flares** - Point away from body, extremely hot, fire hazard
- [ ] **Radio** - Emergency channels (121.5, 243.0) are EMERGENCY ONLY
- [ ] **Whistle** - Don't overuse (exhaustion, wolf-cry effect on rescuers)

### Radio Regulations:
- [ ] **FRS (Family Radio Service)** - License-free, 2W max, channels 1-22
- [ ] **GMRS (General Mobile Radio)** - License required ($70, 10 years), 50W max
- [ ] **HAM (Amateur Radio)** - License required (Technician → General → Extra)
- [ ] **Marine VHF** - Channel 16 is distress ONLY (monitored by Coast Guard)
- [ ] **Aviation 121.5 MHz** - Emergency only, false signals = legal penalties

### When to Signal:
- [ ] **Real emergency only** - False distress signals are illegal, waste resources
- [ ] **Continue signaling** - Rescuers need ongoing signals to home in
- [ ] **Three of anything** - International distress (3 fires, 3 whistle blasts)
- [ ] **Conserve energy** - Signal periodically, not continuously (except radio)

### Legal Considerations:
- [ ] **Radio licensing** - Operating without license = fines, illegal
- [ ] **False distress** - Fines, rescue bill, potential jail time
- [ ] **Flare regulations** - Check local laws, expiration dates matter
- [ ] **Encryption laws** - Some countries restrict civilian crypto use

## 📖 Learning Tips

### Practice Drills:
1. **Mirror aiming:** Hit target 50+ feet away in bright sun (practice before emergency)
2. **Morse code:** Practice SOS until automatic (···---···)
3. **Whistle codes:** 3 blasts, pause, 3 blasts, pause (rhythm matters)
4. **Ground signals:** Lay out 5-meter "V" or "X" with materials (size matters for aerial visibility)
5. **Radio check:** Practice "Mayday" call procedure (voice, calm, repeat)

### Skill Maintenance:
- **Monthly:** Practice Morse SOS, mirror aiming
- **Quarterly:** Review radio protocols, whistle codes
- **Annually:** Refresh ground-to-air symbols, check flare expiration

### Common Mistakes:
1. **Mirror aiming** - Difficult without practice, most people miss target
2. **Smoke color** - Black smoke disappears against trees, white against snow
3. **Whistle overuse** - Exhaustion, rescuers ignore if constant
4. **Radio panic** - Calm, clear voice matters more than shouting
5. **Ground signals too small** - Need 5-10 meters for aerial visibility

### Recommended Progression:
- **Week 1:** Whistle codes, mirror aiming basics
- **Week 2-3:** Morse SOS, ground-to-air symbols
- **Month 2:** Radio basics (if licensed), smoke signals
- **Month 3-4:** Semaphore alphabet, hand signals
- **Month 5-6:** Community coordination, message systems
- **6+ months:** Advanced radio, encryption basics

### Effectiveness Metrics:

**Visual Signaling Range:**
- Mirror (heliograph): 50+ miles (80+ km) in clear conditions
- Smoke: 10-20 miles (16-32 km) daytime only
- Ground panels: Aerial visibility at 1,000+ feet altitude
- Flashlight Morse: 1-5 miles (1.6-8 km) at night

**Audio Signaling Range:**
- Whistle: 0.5-1 mile (0.8-1.6 km) in quiet conditions
- Gunshot: 3+ miles (5+ km) depending on terrain
- Shouting: 0.25 mile (400m) max, exhausting

**Radio Range (VHF/UHF):**
- Handheld (5W): 2-5 miles (3-8 km) terrain-dependent
- Mobile (50W): 10-30 miles (16-48 km)
- HAM repeater: 50+ miles (80+ km) with infrastructure
