## Personal Knowledge (Gitignored)

### `/personal` - Your Content

This directory is **completely yours** and gitignored by default.

**Suggested Organization**:

```
personal/
├── notes/
│   ├── daily/           # Daily logs
│   ├── meetings/        # Meeting notes
│   └── ideas/           # Brainstorming
├── research/
│   ├── papers/          # Research papers
│   ├── experiments/     # Lab notebooks
│   └── findings/        # Results
├── projects/
│   ├── web-app/
│   ├── data-science/
│   └── game-dev/
└── cheatsheets/
    ├── git.md
    ├── python.md
    └── sql.md
```

## Using Knowledge with LEARN Command

**Planned v1.2 Feature** (Priority 3 in ROADMAP.MD):

```bash
# Browse knowledge base
LEARN

# View specific topic
LEARN commands/THEME

# Search knowledge
LEARN SEARCH "theme system"

# View your personal notes
LEARN personal/projects/web-app

# List all in category
LEARN COMMANDS    # Lists all command guides
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- ✅ Organize personal knowledge however works for you
- ✅ Use descriptive filenames (verb-noun: analyze-data.md)
- ✅ Add frontmatter for better searchability
- ✅ Link related articles
- ✅ Keep backups of important notes

### ❌ DON'T

- ❌ Put secrets in tracked knowledge files
- ❌ Modify system knowledge without testing
- ❌ Commit personal/ to git (it's gitignored)
- ❌ Use proprietary formats (stick to .md, .json, .txt)
