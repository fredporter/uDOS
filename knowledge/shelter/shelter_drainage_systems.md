## Overview

In any survival situation, staying dry is paramount for health, comfort, and ultimately, survival. Exposure to moisture, whether from rain, snowmelt, or ground seepage, dramatically increases the risk of hypothermia, dampens morale, ruins gear, and can even compromise the structural integrity of your shelter. A well-designed shelter is only half effective if it doesn't incorporate a robust drainage system to manage water effectively.

Shelter drainage systems are proactive measures taken during shelter construction to divert water away from your sleeping area and the shelter's foundation. This guide focuses on practical, improvised methods suitable for various environments, from temperate forests to areas with heavy rainfall or thawing snow. Understanding the flow of water and employing simple earth-moving techniques can transform a damp, miserable bivouac into a dry, safer haven.

## Materials Needed

*   **Digging Tools:** (Essential) Sturdy stick, sharpened branch, flat rock, improvised spade (e.g., vehicle license plate, piece of bark), or hands/feet. A multi-tool or small shovel (if available) would be ideal.
*   **Rocks/Stones:** (Optional) For lining trenches, creating berms, or reinforcing channels.
*   **Logs/Branches:** (Optional) For lining or reinforcing trenches, creating elevated platforms.
*   **Large Leaves/Bark:** (Optional) For temporary diversion, lining, or improvised ground sheets.
*   **Tarp/Poncho/Ground Sheet:** (Recommended, if available) For use as a ground barrier inside the shelter.
*   **Absorbent Natural Materials:** (Recommended) Dry leaves, pine needles, grass, moss for internal insulation and wicking.
*   **Gloves:** (Recommended) For hand protection during digging and handling rough materials.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Pre-Construction Site Analysis

Before you even begin digging, take time to observe your chosen shelter site. This foresight is crucial for effective drainage.

1.  **Observe Natural Water Flow:** Spend several minutes looking for existing channels, depressions, or stains on the ground that indicate where water naturally flows during rain. Identify natural high and low points.
2.  **Assess Terrain Slope:** Even a subtle slope (grade) is critical. Water always flows downhill. Plan your shelter to be on slightly higher ground than the surrounding area if possible. If on a slope, place your shelter slightly above the steepest part of the slope.
3.  **Check Soil Type:**
    *   **Sandy Soil:** Drains relatively quickly, but can be unstable for trench walls.
    *   **Clay Soil:** Holds water, drains poorly, leading to standing water if not diverted. Requires deeper or wider trenches.
    *   **Rocky Soil:** Difficult to dig but offers natural pathways for water.
4.  **Consider Existing Vegetation:** Dense vegetation can slow water flow and help absorb some moisture, but it can also hide existing water channels or boggy areas. Avoid building in obvious boggy spots.
5.  **Visualize Rain Impact:** Imagine heavy rainfall. Where would the water accumulate? How would it approach your shelter? This mental exercise helps identify critical diversion points.

### 2. External Drainage Systems (Diverting Water Away)

These systems are designed to intercept and redirect water before it reaches your shelter.

#### 2.1 Perimeter Trench (The "French Drain" Concept)

This is the most fundamental and effective external drainage system.

1.  **Mark the Perimeter:** Once your shelter's footprint is established, mark a perimeter roughly 1-2 feet *away* from the outer walls of your shelter. This distance is important to avoid undermining the shelter's foundation.
2.  **Dig the Trench:** Dig a trench around this marked perimeter.
    *   **Depth:** Aim for 6-12 inches deep. Deeper is better in very wet conditions or clay soil.
    *   **Width:** 6-12 inches wide.
    *   **Slope:** The bottom of the trench must have a continuous, gentle slope leading *away* from your shelter to a natural downhill run-off point. It's not enough to just dig a circle; the water needs an exit.
    *   **Angle the Walls:** If soil permits, angle the trench wall closest to your shelter slightly inwards towards the trench bottom. This prevents water from pooling directly against your shelter's base.
3.  **Create a Run-off Channel:** Extend the perimeter trench downhill to a point where water can safely drain away from your immediate area, such as a natural depression, stream, or larger runoff channel.
4.  **Form a Berm (Optional but Recommended):** Use the soil excavated from the trench to create a raised mound (berm) on the shelter-side edge of the trench. This acts as a secondary barrier, preventing water from flowing over the trench directly into your shelter.
5.  **Reinforce (Optional):** If time and materials permit, line the bottom and sides of the trench with rocks or small logs to prevent erosion and maintain the channel's integrity, especially in loose soil.

#### 2.2 Diversion Ditches (Run-off Channels)

These are for intercepting water flowing *towards* your shelter from an uphill direction.

1.  **Identify Uphill Flow Paths:** Look for any natural depressions or low points uphill from your shelter where water would funnel towards it.
2.  **Dig a Catchment Ditch:** Dig a wider, shallower ditch (1-2 ft wide, 4-8 inches deep) *uphill* from your shelter, creating a barrier across these flow paths.
3.  **Angle to Natural Drainage:** Angle this ditch to intercept the water and redirect it around the sides of your shelter, connecting to your perimeter trench or leading to a separate, safe downhill run-off point. Ensure the ditch slopes continuously.

#### 2.3 Roof Run-off Management

If your shelter has a roof (tarp, boughs), manage the water shedding from it.

1.  **Extend Overhangs:** Ensure your roof material extends sufficiently beyond the walls of your shelter (at least 1 foot) so water drips well past your perimeter trenches.
2.  **Improvised Gutters (Optional):** For more sophisticated systems, you can create a simple "gutter" from a folded tarp edge, large pieces of bark, or flexible leaves to concentrate roof runoff and direct it into a specific channel or even a collection vessel for drinking water.

### 3. Internal Ground Preparation (Managing Seepage and Dampness)

Even with external drainage, ground moisture can seep upwards.

#### 3.1 Elevate Sleeping Area

This is crucial for preventing conductive heat loss to the cold, damp ground and for keeping your body out of any minor pooling water.

1.  **Create a Platform:** Use logs, sturdy branches, or stacked rocks to build a raised platform inside your shelter. Even a few inches off the ground makes a significant difference.
2.  **Layer Insulation:** Cover your elevated platform with a thick layer (6-12 inches or more) of dry, insulating natural materials like evergreen boughs, dry leaves, pine needles, or grass. These materials trap air, providing insulation, and will also absorb minor moisture.
3.  **Ground Sheet/Vapor Barrier:** If available, lay a tarp, poncho, or large plastic sheet directly on your raised insulation or under it. This acts as a vapor barrier, preventing ground moisture from rising through the insulation to your sleeping bag or clothes.
    *   **Crucial Tip:** Ensure the edges of your ground sheet are tucked *under* your sleeping pad/bedding or slightly folded upwards like a bathtub, so it doesn't catch any internal drips or run-off. Never let it extend outside the shelter's footprint, as it will collect water and funnel it in.

#### 3.2 Internal Sump (For Persistent Seepage in Extreme Conditions)

Use this as a last resort in very boggy or perpetually wet ground conditions, and only with extreme caution.

1.  **Locate Lowest Point:** Identify the absolute lowest point within your shelter's floor.
2.  **Dig Small Pit:** Dig a small, shallow pit (6-12 inches diameter, 6-12 inches deep) at this lowest point.
3.  **Lining (Optional):** Line the pit with rocks or larger pebbles to help keep it from filling with mud.
4.  **Purpose:** This pit acts as a collection point for any unavoidable ground seepage. You will need to periodically bail water out of it. *Warning: If not properly isolated from the surrounding ground, a sump can inadvertently attract more water into your shelter. Combine with good external drainage and ground sheets.*

## Safety Considerations

*   **Flash Floods:** No drainage system can protect against a flash flood. Prioritize site selection (high ground, away from washes) above all else in flood-prone areas.
*   **Structural Integrity:** Digging too deep or too close to the main supports of your shelter can undermine its stability and lead to collapse. Maintain a safe distance.
*   **Tool Use and Fatigue:** Digging can be physically demanding. Use your improvised tools safely, take breaks, and conserve energy. Protect your hands.
*   **Wildlife:** Trenches can sometimes trap small animals, insects, or snakes seeking shelter. Exercise caution when approaching and inspecting trenches.
*   **Hypothermia Prevention:** The ultimate goal of drainage is to prevent you from getting wet and, consequently, cold. Stay vigilant for signs of hypothermia.
*   **Contamination:** If collecting roof runoff for drinking, ensure the collection surface and vessel are clean to avoid contamination.

## Common Mistakes

*   **Insufficient Slope:** A trench that is not continuously sloped will simply become a stagnant pool or bathtub, potentially funneling water into your shelter rather than away.
*   **No Outlet for Trenches:** A perimeter trench that completely encircles your shelter but has no downhill exit point will just fill with water. All trenches *must* lead to a lower, safe run-off area.
*   **Trench Too Close to Shelter:** Digging too close can undermine the soil supporting your shelter walls, making it unstable and prone to collapse.
*   **Ignoring Uphill Water:** Only focusing on perimeter drainage will not protect you from water flowing directly towards your shelter from higher ground. Diversion ditches are key.
*   **Flat Ground Sheets:** Letting a ground sheet extend outside your sleeping area or be completely flat will allow water to pool on it, making your bedding wet. Ensure it forms a "bathtub" or is tucked under.
*   **Underestimating Water Volume:** What seems like a small amount of rain can quickly accumulate. Always assume heavier rainfall than you anticipate.
*   **Clogged Trenches:** Leaves, mud, and debris can quickly clog a trench, rendering it useless. Periodically check and clear your drainage system.
*   **Building in a Depressions:** Even with drainage, building directly in a low-lying depression makes you vulnerable to collecting water from the entire surrounding area.
