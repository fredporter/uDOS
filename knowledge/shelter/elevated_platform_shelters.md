# Elevated Platform Shelters

An elevated platform shelter provides critical protection from ground-level threats such as dampness, cold, insects, and predators. By raising your sleeping area off the ground, you create a drier, safer, and often more comfortable resting place. This guide focuses on constructing a sturdy, ground-supported platform, adaptable to various wilderness environments.

## Materials Needed

*   **Main Support Poles (4-6):** Strong, straight poles, 3-4 inches (7-10 cm) in diameter, 5-7 feet (1.5-2.1 m) long. Hardwoods are preferred.
*   **Platform Frame Poles (2-4):** Straight poles, 2-3 inches (5-7 cm) in diameter, slightly longer than your intended platform length/width.
*   **Cross Support Poles (6-10+):** Smaller, straight branches, 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) in diameter, spanning the width of your platform.
*   **Sleeping Surface Material:** Small branches, reeds, leafy vegetation, a tarp, or an emergency blanket.
*   **Lashing Material:** Approximately 50-100 feet (15-30 m) of strong cordage (paracord, rope, strong vines, inner bark strips).
*   **Cutting Tool:** A sturdy knife, axe, or saw.
*   **Digging Tool (Optional):** A small shovel or strong stick for digging post holes.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Site Selection:** Choose a relatively flat, stable area near your chosen resources (water, firewood) but away from potential hazards like dead trees or flash flood zones. Ensure the ground is firm enough to support the main posts.
2.  **Gather Materials:** Collect all necessary poles and lashing material. Process poles to appropriate lengths using your cutting tool. Aim for a platform height of 1.5-3 feet (0.45-0.9 m) off the ground, adjusting pole lengths accordingly.
3.  **Erect Main Supports (S3):** Dig or drive four main support poles into the ground to form a rectangle, roughly 3 feet (0.9 m) wide by 6-7 feet (1.8-2.1 m) long (adjust for your height). Dig holes 1-1.5 feet (30-45 cm) deep for maximum stability, or drive poles firmly. Ensure the tops of the poles are level. For extra stability, use six poles (two on each long side, one at each end).
4.  **Attach Platform Frame (S5
