## ⚠️ Critical Safety Rules

### BEFORE Building:
- [ ] Check overhead for dead branches ("widow makers")
- [ ] Assess flash flood risk (dry washes, low areas)
- [ ] Verify site is 200+ feet from water (flood zone)
- [ ] Look for animal signs (dens, scat, trails)
- [ ] Check wind patterns (avoid constant exposure)

### DURING Construction:
- [ ] Never fell trees without training
- [ ] Test branch strength before climbing
- [ ] Use proper knots (no slip knots for critical loads)
- [ ] Maintain three points of contact when elevated

### AFTER Completion:
- [ ] Ensure proper ventilation (CO₂ poisoning risk)
- [ ] Test drainage before weather event
- [ ] Mark hazards inside shelter (sharp sticks)
- [ ] Never heat enclosed shelter without ventilation
- [ ] Keep fire 10+ feet from flammable materials

### Snow Shelters Specific:
- [ ] ALWAYS maintain ventilation hole
- [ ] Mark entrance with stick (avalanche burial)
- [ ] Never seal completely (suffocation risk)
- [ ] Test for carbon monoxide if using heat source

## 📖 Learning Tips

1. **Build Small First:** Practice with 1/4 scale models before full-size
2. **Time Yourself:** Emergency shelter should take <2 hours
3. **Test in Rain:** Build, then pour water on it (before you need it)
4. **Layer Your Learning:** Tarp → lean-to → a-frame → debris hut
5. **Knots Matter:** Master 5 knots: bowline, taut-line, clove hitch, square lashing, diagonal lashing
6. **Site Selection is 50%:** Good site = easier shelter
7. **Practice in Daylight:** Never learn new shelter in darkness/emergency

**Recommended Progression Time:**
- Beginner shelters: Practice 3-5 times each
- Intermediate: Build in different seasons
- Advanced: Overnight testing required
- Expert: Teach others to verify mastery
