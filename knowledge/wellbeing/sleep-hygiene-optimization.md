## Understanding Sleep

### Sleep Cycles

**What happens when you sleep:**

```
Sleep Cycle (~90 minutes, repeats 4-6 times per night):

Stage 1: Light sleep (5-10 min)
├─ Transition from wake to sleep
├─ Easy to wake
└─ Muscle twitches common

Stage 2: Deeper light sleep (20 min)
├─ Heart rate slows
├─ Body temperature drops
├─ Brain activity slows
└─ 50% of night spent here

Stage 3: Deep sleep (slow-wave, 20-40 min)
├─ Hardest to wake from
├─ Physical restoration
├─ Immune system strengthened
├─ Growth hormone released
└─ Critical for feeling refreshed

REM (Rapid Eye Movement, 10-60 min)
├─ Dreams occur (vivid)
├─ Brain active (learning consolidation)
├─ Body paralyzed (prevents acting out dreams)
├─ Emotional processing
└─ Increases toward morning

Optimal: Complete 4-6 full cycles
Waking mid-cycle = groggy, unrefreshed
```

---

### Sleep Stages Throughout Night

```
        Deep
        Sleep
          ↑
          │ ███
          │ ███  ██
          │ ███  ██   █
          │ ███  ██   █    REM
   Light→ │ ███  ██ █ █  ██ █ REM
   Sleep  │ ███  ██ █ █  ██ █ REM
          │ ███  ██ █ █  ██ █ REM
          └──────────────────────────→ Time
            C1   C2  C3  C4   C5  C6

Early night: More deep sleep (physical restoration)
Late night: More REM sleep (mental/emotional processing)

Full night = both essential
```

---

### Circadian Rhythm

**Your body's 24-hour clock:**

```
Controlled by:
├─ Light exposure (primary)
├─ Meal timing
├─ Exercise timing
├─ Social cues
└─ Temperature

Daily pattern (typical):
├─ 6-7am: Cortisol rises (wake hormone)
├─ 9am: Peak alertness
├─ 2-3pm: Dip (post-lunch, natural)
├─ 6pm: Peak body temperature
├─ 9pm: Melatonin starts (sleep hormone)
├─ 10-11pm: Bowel movements suppressed
├─ 2am: Deepest sleep
├─ 4am: Lowest body temperature
└─ Repeat

Disrupting this = jet lag, shift work problems, poor sleep
```

---

## The Ideal Sleep Environment

### Bedroom Setup

**Temperature:**
```
Optimal: 16-20°C (60-68°F)
├─ Cool room = better sleep
├─ Body temperature drops during sleep
├─ Too hot = restless, sweating
└─ Too cold = wakefulness, shivering

Australian context:
├─ Summer: Fan, breathable bedding, open windows (cool night air)
├─ Winter: Heat bedroom before bed, then turn off (or very low)
└─ Avoid electric blanket on all night (overheating)
```

---

**Darkness:**
```
Light = wake signal to brain
├─ Blackout curtains (best)
├─ Eye mask (if curtains not possible)
├─ Cover/remove LED lights (electronics, clocks)
├─ Night lights = red/amber only (least disruptive)
└─ Even small light = reduced melatonin

Moonlight is OK (natural, low level)
Street lights = problem (curtains needed)
```

---

**Noise:**
```
Quiet = best
├─ Earplugs (foam, custom-molded)
├─ White noise machine (masks irregular sounds)
├─ Fan (cooling + white noise)
└─ Address sources (noisy neighbors, traffic)

White noise vs silence:
├─ Total silence ideal IF achievable
├─ White noise better than irregular noise (dog barking, traffic)
└─ Personal preference varies
```

---

**Bed & Bedding:**
```
Mattress:
├─ Comfortable (personal preference)
├─ Supportive (spine alignment)
├─ Replace every 8-10 years
├─ Test before buying (lie down 10+ minutes)
└─ Medium-firm suits most people

Pillows:
├─ Support neck (spine straight)
├─ Side sleeper: Thicker pillow
├─ Back sleeper: Medium pillow
├─ Stomach sleeper: Thin pillow (or none)
└─ Replace every 1-2 years

Bedding:
├─ Breathable (cotton, bamboo, linen)
├─ Avoid synthetic (sweating, overheating)
├─ Wash weekly (dust mites, freshness)
└─ Seasonal (summer: light cotton, winter: flannel/thicker)
```

---

**Bedroom Use:**
```
Sleep & intimacy ONLY
├─ No TV in bedroom
├─ No work/laptop
├─ No eating
├─ No scrolling phone in bed
└─ Brain associates bed = sleep

Exception: Reading (if relaxing, not stimulating)
```

---

## Sleep Hygiene Practices

### Evening Routine (1-2 Hours Before Bed)

**Light Management:**
```
Dim lights progressively:
├─ Sunset = cue for melatonin production
├─ Bright lights = wake signal (suppresses melatonin)
├─ Use dim, warm lights (amber/red)
├─ Avoid blue light (screens, LED)
└─ F.lux or Night Shift on devices (if must use)

Australian context:
├─ Summer: Still light at 8-9pm (use curtains, dim indoor)
├─ Winter: Natural darkness helps
└─ Daylight saving affects routine (adjust gradually)
```

---

**Screen Time:**
```
STOP screens 1-2 hours before bed
├─ Blue light = powerful wake signal
├─ Stimulating content (news, social media, work emails)
├─ Brain arousal = delayed sleep onset
└─ "Just 5 minutes" becomes 30+ (addictive)

If MUST use screens:
├─ Blue light filter (Night Shift, F.lux)
├─ Lowest brightness
├─ Relaxing content only (not news/social media)
└─ Still inferior to no screens
```

---

**Wind-Down Activities:**
```
Calm, relaxing activities:
├─ Reading (physical book, warm light)
├─ Gentle stretching or yoga
├─ Warm bath/shower (body temp drop after = sleepy)
├─ Meditation or breathing exercises
├─ Listening to calming music or audiobook
├─ Journaling (worries on paper = out of mind)
└─ Light household tasks (folding laundry, tidying)

Avoid:
├─ Exercise (energizing, raises body temp)
├─ Intense mental work (problem-solving, planning)
├─ Emotional conversations (arguments)
└─ Stimulating entertainment (action movies, thriller books)
```

---

**The 4-7-8 Breathing (Sleep Induction):**
```
In bed, lights off:
1. Exhale completely through mouth
2. Breathe in through nose: 4 counts
3. Hold breath: 7 counts
4. Exhale through mouth: 8 counts (whoosh sound)
5. Repeat 4-8 cycles

Effect:
├─ Slows heart rate
├─ Activates parasympathetic nervous system (rest/digest)
├─ Reduces anxiety
└─ Often asleep by cycle 4
```

---

### Morning Routine

**Wake at Same Time (Even Weekends):**
```
Regulates circadian rhythm:
├─ Body learns when to wake
├─ Melatonin production timed correctly
├─ Easier to fall asleep at night
└─ Consistent sleep quality

"Sleeping in" on weekends:
├─ Disrupts rhythm (social jet lag)
├─ Monday harder to wake
├─ Worse sleep quality overall
└─ If needed, max 1 hour later than weekday
```

---

**Light Exposure (Critical!):**
```
Bright light within 30 minutes of waking:
├─ Suppresses melatonin (wake up!)
├─ Starts 14-16 hour timer to next melatonin release
├─ Regulates circadian rhythm
└─ Improves mood (especially winter)

Best: Outdoor sunlight
├─ 10-30 minutes outside (morning sun)
├─ Even cloudy day = brighter than indoor
└─ Walk, coffee outside, open curtains wide

Can't get outside?
└─ Bright light therapy box (10,000 lux, 20-30 min)
```

---

**Morning Exercise:**
```
Benefits for sleep:
├─ Increases sleep pressure (adenosine)
├─ Regulates circadian rhythm
├─ Reduces stress (cortisol management)
└─ Improves deep sleep quality

Timing:
├─ Morning or afternoon: Best for sleep
├─ Avoid intense exercise 3 hours before bed
└─ Gentle evening yoga/stretching OK
```

---

## Daytime Practices

### Caffeine Management

**Half-life: 5-6 hours**

```
Caffeine timeline:
├─ 2pm coffee (200mg)
├─ 8pm: 100mg still in system
├─ 2am: 50mg still in system
└─ Disrupts sleep even if you "feel fine"

Guidelines:
├─ Last caffeine by 2pm (latest)
├─ Earlier for sensitive people (noon or morning only)
├─ Remember hidden caffeine:
│  ├─ Tea (30-50mg)
│  ├─ Chocolate (10-30mg)
│  ├─ Soft drinks (30-55mg)
│  └─ Energy drinks (80-300mg+)
└─ Reduce overall intake if sleep problems

Withdrawal headaches (if cutting back):
└─ Gradual reduction (over 1-2 weeks)
```

---

### Alcohol

**Myth: "Nightcap helps sleep"**

```
Reality:
├─ Makes you drowsy (fall asleep faster)
├─ BUT: Disrupts sleep cycles
├─ Reduces REM sleep (mental recovery)
├─ Causes middle-of-night waking (metabolism)
├─ Dehydration (more waking)
└─ Overall: Worse sleep quality

Guidelines:
├─ Avoid alcohol 3-4 hours before bed
├─ If drinking, earlier in evening
├─ Hydrate well (water between drinks)
└─ Expect worse sleep (plan accordingly)
```

---

### Napping

**Strategic napping:**

```
╔════════════════════╦═══════════════════════════════╗
║ NAP LENGTH        ║ EFFECT                        ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ 10-20 minutes     ║ IDEAL - Refreshing, no        ║
║ (Power nap)       ║ grogginess, doesn't affect    ║
║                   ║ night sleep                   ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ 30-60 minutes     ║ AVOID - Enter deep sleep,     ║
║                   ║ wake groggy (sleep inertia)   ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ 90 minutes        ║ Full cycle - No grogginess,   ║
║ (Full cycle)      ║ but may affect night sleep    ║
╚════════════════════╩═══════════════════════════════╝

Timing:
├─ Before 3pm (later = night sleep disruption)
├─ Best: 1-3pm (natural dip in alertness)
└─ Not if insomnia (skip naps, build sleep pressure)

Set alarm (even for 20 min nap - easy to oversleep)
```

---

### Meal Timing

**Eating affects sleep:**

```
Heavy meal too close to bed:
├─ Digestion = body active (not resting)
├─ Heartburn/reflux (lying down)
├─ Blood sugar swings
└─ Discomfort

Guidelines:
├─ Last large meal: 3+ hours before bed
├─ Light snack OK if hungry (1 hour before)
├─ Avoid spicy, fatty, acidic (reflux risk)
└─ Small protein + carb snack best (if needed)

Good bedtime snack (if hungry):
├─ Banana (magnesium, tryptophan)
├─ Small bowl oats (carbs, serotonin)
├─ Chamomile tea + crackers
└─ Small yogurt
```

---

## Common Sleep Problems

### Insomnia (Difficulty Falling/Staying Asleep)

**If can't fall asleep within 20 minutes:**

```
DON'T:
├─ Lie awake trying to force sleep (anxiety builds)
├─ Check clock repeatedly (stresses you)
├─ Grab phone (blue light, stimulation)
└─ Toss and turn (bed = frustration)

DO:
├─ Get up, leave bedroom
├─ Do quiet, boring activity (read dull book, fold laundry)
├─ Dim light only
├─ Return to bed when sleepy (not exhausted, sleepy)
└─ Repeat if needed

This breaks bed = wakefulness association
```

---

**Racing thoughts:**

```
Strategies:
├─ Brain dump journal (before bed, write worries)
├─ Tomorrow list (tasks on paper, out of mind)
├─ Cognitive shuffle (imagine random objects: apple, shoe, cloud...)
├─ Body scan meditation (focus on relaxing each part)
└─ 4-7-8 breathing (see above)

Avoid:
├─ Problem-solving in bed
├─ Planning next day
└─ Worrying about not sleeping (makes it worse!)
```

---

### Sleep Apnea (Breathing Stops During Sleep)

**Warning signs:**

```
Symptoms:
├─ Loud snoring (especially with pauses/gasps)
├─ Partner observes breathing stops
├─ Waking gasping or choking
├─ Morning headaches
├─ Daytime exhaustion (despite "sleeping")
├─ Dry mouth on waking
└─ Mood changes, irritability

Risk factors:
├─ Overweight (most common)
├─ Large neck circumference
├─ Older age
├─ Male (but women too)
└─ Alcohol use

ACTION:
└─ See GP immediately (sleep study, CPAP machine may be needed)
   Untreated = heart disease, stroke, diabetes risk
```

---

### Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS)

**Uncomfortable sensations in legs, urge to move:**

```
Symptoms:
├─ Crawling, tingling, aching in legs
├─ Worse when resting (especially evening/bed)
├─ Relief with movement
└─ Prevents sleep onset

Common causes:
├─ Iron deficiency (check with blood test)
├─ Pregnancy
├─ Some medications
└─ Unknown (many cases)

Strategies:
├─ Iron supplement (if deficient - test first)
├─ Magnesium (may help)
├─ Avoid caffeine
├─ Leg massage before bed
├─ Moderate exercise (but not before bed)
└─ GP referral if severe
```

---

### Night Terrors vs Nightmares

```
╔════════════════════╦═══════════════╦═══════════════╗
║ CHARACTERISTIC    ║ NIGHT TERRORS ║ NIGHTMARES    ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════╬═══════════════╣
║ Sleep stage       ║ Deep sleep    ║ REM           ║
║ Timing            ║ First 3 hours ║ Later night   ║
║ Memory            ║ None          ║ Remembers     ║
║ Waking            ║ Hard to wake  ║ May wake      ║
║ Age               ║ Kids (3-8)    ║ Any age       ║
╚════════════════════╩═══════════════╩═══════════════╝

Night terrors (children):
├─ Don't wake child (confused, prolonged)
├─ Keep safe (can't be hurt)
├─ Most outgrow
└─ If frequent, see pediatrician

Nightmares (adults):
├─ Stress, trauma, medications
├─ Keep sleep routine
├─ Process emotions during day
└─ Therapy if PTSD-related
```

---

## Shift Work & Irregular Schedules

**Challenges:**

```
├─ Fighting circadian rhythm
├─ Light exposure at wrong times
├─ Social isolation
├─ Health risks (long-term)
└─ Difficult but manageable
```

**Strategies:**

```
Night shift:
├─ Sleep in dark room (blackout essential)
├─ Sunglasses on way home (block morning sun)
├─ Consistent schedule (same sleep time even days off)
├─ Melatonin supplement (0.5-3mg before day-sleep)
├─ Earplugs (daytime noise)
└─ Alert family (protect sleep time)

Rotating shifts:
├─ Rotate forward (easier: days→evenings→nights)
├─ Bright light at work (stay alert)
├─ Gradual adjustment (shift sleep 1-2 hours/day)
└─ Most difficult (health risks higher)

Recovery:
├─ Regular health checks (higher disease risk)
├─ Prioritize sleep on days off
├─ Consider job change if health declining
└─ Not sustainable for everyone long-term
```

## Sleep Aids

### Natural Supplements

```
╔════════════════════╦═══════════════════════════════╗
║ SUPPLEMENT        ║ NOTES                         ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ Melatonin         ║ 0.5-3mg, 30-60min before bed  ║
║                   ║ Regulates rhythm (jet lag,    ║
║                   ║ shift work). Not addictive.   ║
║                   ║ Start low dose.               ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣

║                   ║ Calming, mild effect          ║
╚════════════════════╩═══════════════════════════════╝

Always consult GP before supplements (interactions, conditions)
```

---

### Prescription Sleep Medications

**Use with caution:**

```
Types:
├─ Benzodiazepines (Temazepam, etc.)
├─ Z-drugs (Zolpidem, etc.)
├─ Antihistamines (sedating)
└─ Antidepressants (if depression present)

Risks:
├─ Dependence (tolerance builds)
├─ Reduced deep sleep (lower quality)
├─ Grogginess next day
├─ Falls (especially elderly)
├─ Memory issues
└─ Withdrawal difficulty

When appropriate:
├─ Short-term crisis (bereavement, trauma)
├─ Under medical supervision
├─ With plan to discontinue
├─ Alongside sleep hygiene improvement
└─ NOT long-term solution

Better approach:
└─ Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)
   - Evidence shows better than medication long-term
   - GP or psychologist referral
```

---

## Emergency Rest (When Can't Sleep Enough)

**Damage control:**

```
If only getting 4-5 hours:
├─ Prioritize consistency (same time, even if short)
├─ Make that sleep QUALITY (dark, cool, quiet)
├─ Strategic caffeine (morning only, not afternoon)
├─ 20-min power nap (if possible)
├─ Light exposure (morning, regulate rhythm)
└─ Plan catch-up (weekend recovery sleep)

Micro-rest techniques:
├─ 10-min meditation (restores some cognitive function)
├─ Close eyes 5 min (even without sleep)
├─ Yoga nidra (guided relaxation, 20-30 min)
└─ Nature break (even brief, restorative)

Prioritize fixing:
└─ Chronic sleep debt = serious health consequences
   If ongoing, must address root cause
```

---

## Sleep Tracking

**Tools:**

```
Free:
├─ Sleep diary (paper, note time in/out, quality)
├─ Bedroom clock (manual tracking)
└─ Phone apps (Sleep Cycle, etc. - OK but blue light risk)

Paid:
├─ Fitness trackers (Fitbit, Garmin - track movement/HR)
├─ Smart rings (Oura - detailed, pricey)
└─ Sleep apps (premium features)

Value:
├─ Identify patterns (what helps/hurts)
├─ Objective data (vs perceived sleep)
├─ Motivation (seeing progress)
└─ Don't obsess (orthosomnia - anxiety about tracking)
```

---

## Children & Sleep

**Age-specific needs:**

```
╔════════════════════╦═══════════════════════════════╗
║ AGE               ║ RECOMMENDED HOURS             ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ Newborn (0-3mo)   ║ 14-17 hours (broken)          ║
║ Infant (4-11mo)   ║ 12-15 hours (naps + night)    ║
║ Toddler (1-2yr)   ║ 11-14 hours (1-2 naps)        ║
║ Preschool (3-5yr) ║ 10-13 hours                   ║
║ School (6-13yr)   ║ 9-11 hours                    ║
║ Teen (14-17yr)    ║ 8-10 hours                    ║
║ Adult (18-64yr)   ║ 7-9 hours                     ║
║ Older (65+)       ║ 7-8 hours                     ║
╚════════════════════╩═══════════════════════════════╝

Kids: Routine critical (same bedtime, calming routine)
Teens: Biological shift (later sleep, later wake - conflicts with school)
```
