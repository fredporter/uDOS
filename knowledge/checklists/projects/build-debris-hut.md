## Pre-Construction Planning

### Site Selection (30 minutes)
- [ ] Find location 200+ feet from water (flood risk)
- [ ] Check overhead for dead branches ("widow makers")
- [ ] Verify flat or slightly sloped ground (drainage)
- [ ] Avoid animal trails or dens (scat, tracks, burrows)
- [ ] Confirm adequate building materials nearby (branches, leaves, bark)
- [ ] Test wind direction (shelter opening away from prevailing wind)
- [ ] Ensure no flash flood risk (dry washes, gullies)
- [ ] Look for natural windbreak (rock, dense vegetation)

### Material Assessment
- [ ] Ridge pole: 1x straight branch, 9-12 ft long, 3-4 inches diameter
- [ ] Ribs: 20-30x branches, 6-8 ft long, 1-2 inches diameter
- [ ] Debris: Enough to fill 3x your body volume (leaves, pine needles, grass, bark)
- [ ] Bedding: Fill interior to 2-3 ft depth (more insulation)
- [ ] Optional: Large flat rocks for base (moisture barrier)

---

## Phase 1: Framework Construction (2-3 hours)

### Step 1: Establish Ridge Pole
- [ ] Find or prop ridge pole at 3-4 ft height on one end
- [ ] Secure against tree, stump, or forked branch
- [ ] Other end rests on ground (creates sloped tunnel)
- [ ] Test stability (should not shift when pushed)
- [ ] Angle: ~30-45 degrees from ground

### Step 2: Build Ribbing Structure
- [ ] Lean ribs along BOTH sides of ridge pole
- [ ] Angle ribs at ~45-60 degrees (steeper = rain runoff)
- [ ] Space ribs 6-12 inches apart
- [ ] Longest ribs at entrance, shorter toward back
- [ ] Create A-frame triangle cross-section
- [ ] Extend ribs past ridge pole base (entrance threshold)
- [ ] Interweave small sticks horizontally (latticework)

### Step 3: Verify Structural Integrity
- [ ] Gently press on framework (should be rigid)
- [ ] Check for large gaps (will leak debris)
- [ ] Ensure entrance height: 2-3 ft (crawl-in size)
- [ ] Interior length: 1-2 ft longer than your body
- [ ] Interior width: Just wider than shoulders (conserves heat)

---

## Phase 2: Debris Insulation Layer (2-3 hours)

### Step 4: Apply First Layer (Latticework)
- [ ] Add smaller sticks/twigs perpendicular to ribs
- [ ] Create criss-cross lattice (prevents debris falling through)
- [ ] Fill any large gaps with bark or broad leaves
- [ ] Don't compress – maintain air pockets (insulation)

### Step 5: Add Bulk Debris (Main Insulation)
- [ ] **Start at bottom** of shelter, work upward
- [ ] Pile leaves, pine needles, grass, bark
- [ ] Target thickness: **3+ feet** on all sides (critical for hypothermia prevention)
- [ ] Pack heavier materials (bark slabs) on top (weight holds debris)
- [ ] Leave entrance area clear for now
- [ ] Feather debris into ground (water diversion)

### Step 6: Weatherproofing Layer
- [ ] Add bark slabs, large leaves, or sod on top (shingle pattern)
- [ ] Overlap like roof shingles (water runs down, not through)
- [ ] Secure with small branches laid across
- [ ] Add more debris on top of bark layer
- [ ] Check for thin spots (sunlight visible = needs more)

### Step 7: Interior Bedding
- [ ] Fill interior with DRY debris (2-3 ft deep minimum)
- [ ] Fluff leaves/pine needles (air pockets = insulation)
- [ ] Create nest depression (body-shaped)
- [ ] Test comfort and insulation by lying in it
- [ ] Add more if you feel cold from ground

---

## Phase 3: Finishing Touches (30-60 minutes)

### Step 8: Entrance Construction
- [ ] Build entrance plug (bundle of branches/debris)
- [ ] Size: Slightly larger than entrance opening
- [ ] Attach cordage or vine (pull from inside to close)
- [ ] Test fit: Should seal entrance with minimal gaps
- [ ] Pile extra debris near entrance (add at night for warmth)

### Step 9: Drainage System
- [ ] Dig shallow trench around shelter (6 inches deep)
- [ ] Direct water away from entrance
- [ ] Ensure trench slopes downhill
- [ ] Test with poured water (should divert away)
- [ ] Pile excavated dirt outside trench (berm)

### Step 10: Marker & Accessibility
- [ ] Mark entrance with bright-colored cloth or reflective tape
- [ ] Clear approach path of tripping hazards
- [ ] Pile firewood nearby (if building fire)
- [ ] Create sitting area outside entrance
- [ ] Note: Keep fire 10+ feet from shelter (spark risk)

---

## Testing & Verification (30 minutes)

### Structural Tests
- [ ] Crawl in and out 3x (check for collapse points)
- [ ] Gently push on walls from inside (should be firm)
- [ ] Check for debris raining down when touched
- [ ] Verify no sharp sticks poking through
- [ ] Ensure adequate headroom (sitting height at entrance)

### Weatherproofing Tests
- [ ] Pour water on roof (should run off, not through)
- [ ] Check interior for wet spots
- [ ] Inspect for daylight gaps (seal with more debris)
- [ ] Test entrance plug seal (should block wind)
- [ ] Verify drainage trench function

### Comfort & Safety Tests
- [ ] Lie inside for 10 minutes (assess comfort)
- [ ] Check for cold spots (ground, walls, roof)
- [ ] Ensure no claustrophobia (emergency exits?)
- [ ] Verify ventilation (slight airflow, not drafty)
- [ ] Test emergency exit (can you exit quickly?)

### Overnight Preparation
- [ ] Add extra bedding debris (better over-insulated)
- [ ] Collect entrance plug materials
- [ ] Remove sharp objects from interior
- [ ] Prepare water, food, tools nearby
- [ ] Inform someone of shelter location

---

## Maintenance & Improvements

### Daily Maintenance
- [ ] Fluff interior bedding (compressed = less insulation)
- [ ] Add debris to roof if rain thinned it
- [ ] Check for animal intrusion (tracks, scat)
- [ ] Clear entrance of fallen debris
- [ ] Inspect framework for damage

### Weekly Improvements
- [ ] Reinforce framework (add ribs if sagging)
- [ ] Add more debris (settles over time)
- [ ] Improve drainage if pooling observed
- [ ] Enhance entrance door (better seal)
- [ ] Consider smoke hole if adding heat source (DANGEROUS - see safety)

---

## Safety Checklist

### CRITICAL SAFETY RULES
- [ ] **NEVER use fire/flame inside debris hut** (extremely flammable)
- [ ] **Ventilation mandatory** if using any heat source nearby
- [ ] Check for widow makers overhead DAILY
- [ ] Test structural stability before entering after storm
- [ ] Clear emergency exit path
- [ ] Inform someone of shelter location
- [ ] Have backup shelter plan (collapse, fire, flood)

### Hazards to Avoid
- [ ] Building in dry wash or flood-prone area
- [ ] Using green (wet) wood in freezing temps (ice buildup)
- [ ] Over-compacting debris (reduces insulation)
- [ ] Building too large (harder to heat with body warmth)
- [ ] Sealing entrance completely (CO₂ buildup, suffocation)
- [ ] Disturbing wasp/hornet nests while gathering materials
- [ ] Using poison oak, ivy, or sumac (severe rash)

## Performance Expectations

### Insulation Capability
- **3 ft debris:** Survive to 20°F (-7°C) if dry
- **2 ft debris:** Survive to 32°F (0°C)
- **1 ft debris:** Minimal protection, emergency only

### Lifespan
- **Well-built:** 2-4 weeks
- **Poorly built:** 1 week or less
- **Rainy climate:** Shorter (debris compacts, loses loft)

### Comfort Level
- **Pros:** Excellent insulation, natural materials, no tools required
- **Cons:** Dirty, cramped, bugs, labor-intensive, maintenance needed

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too little debris** - Most critical error. Need 3+ feet for hypothermia protection.
2. **Wrong site selection** - Flood zones, dead tree overhead, too far from water.
3. **Building too large** - Cannot heat with body warmth alone.
4. **Insufficient bedding** - Ground cold sucks heat, need 2-3 ft under you.
5. **Entrance faces wind** - Negates insulation, cold air pours in.
6. **No weatherproofing layer** - Debris washes away in first rain.
7. **Compressed debris** - Air pockets = insulation. Don't pack tight.
8. **Skipping drainage** - Shelter floods, debris saturated, hypothermia risk.
9. **Using campfire inside** - FIRE HAZARD. Debris huts are highly flammable.
10. **Not testing before dark** - Find problems in daylight, not midnight.

## Upgrade Paths

### Immediate Improvements (Day 2-3)
- [ ] Add tarp over roof (if available) for waterproofing
- [ ] Build elevated bed frame (sticks lashed together)
- [ ] Create tool/gear alcove at entrance
- [ ] Add second insulation layer to roof
- [ ] Build better entrance door (woven branches)

### Long-Term Improvements (Week 2+)
- [ ] Construct permanent framework (lashed poles)
- [ ] Add bark or sod roof over debris
- [ ] Build rock foundation (moisture barrier)
- [ ] Create vestibule entrance (gear storage)
- [ ] Install smoke hole for **external** fire (controlled ventilation)

### Conversion to Semi-Permanent
- [ ] Replace debris with bark slabs or thatch
- [ ] Build raised sleeping platform
- [ ] Add storage compartments
- [ ] Construct fire reflector wall outside
- [ ] Dig cold storage pit nearby

## Alternative Designs

### One-Person Minimum Survival
- **Dimensions:** 3 ft high x 6 ft long x 2 ft wide
- **Debris:** 2 ft thick (emergency minimum)
- **Time:** 2-3 hours

### Two-Person Shelter
- **Dimensions:** 4 ft high x 8 ft long x 4 ft wide
- **Debris:** 3 ft thick
- **Time:** 6-8 hours

### Group Shelter (4+ people)
- **Consider:** Build multiple individual shelters instead
- **Why:** Easier to heat with body warmth, faster construction
- **Exception:** If ample materials and time, large debris lodge possible (12+ hours)

---

## Tools Needed (Minimal)

### Required
- [ ] None (can build with bare hands)

### Recommended (speeds construction 50%)
- [ ] Fixed-blade knife (cutting cordage, notching)
- [ ] Small saw or hatchet (cutting ridge pole, ribs)
- [ ] Work gloves (prevent blisters, splinters)

### Optional
- [ ] Tarp (waterproofing layer)
- [ ] Paracord (lashing framework)
- [ ] Folding shovel (digging drainage)

---

## Environmental Impact

### Leave No Trace Considerations
- [ ] Dismantle shelter when leaving (scatter materials)
- [ ] Fill drainage trenches
- [ ] Avoid damaging live vegetation
- [ ] Don't strip bark from living trees
- [ ] Use dead/down wood only
- [ ] Return area to natural state

### Sustainable Harvesting
- [ ] Collect debris from wide area (don't denude one spot)
- [ ] Leave enough for ecosystem (animals use too)
- [ ] Prefer invasive species for materials
- [ ] Don't disturb nesting birds or wildlife
