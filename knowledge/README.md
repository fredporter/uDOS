# Knowledge Library

**Purpose**: Read-only reference library for uDOS system knowledge and documentation.

## What Goes Here

This folder contains **reference materials only**:
- Command syntax guides
- System architecture documentation
- API references
- Example code snippets (non-executable)
- Best practices guides
- Glossaries and lexicons

## What Doesn't Go Here

- ❌ Test scripts (→ `/sandbox/tests/`)
- ❌ Working files (→ `/sandbox/`)
- ❌ User data (→ `/memory/`)
- ❌ Development notes (→ `/docs/`)

## Future Content

This folder will be populated with:
- uCODE syntax reference
- Command module documentation
- System architecture diagrams
- Extension development guides
- Migration guides
- Troubleshooting references

## Usage

Think of this as a **library** - you read from it, but don't write to it during normal operations.

Files here should be carefully curated and version controlled.
