## Overview

# Route Planning

Route planning is the foundational skill for any successful journey in a survival scenario, ensuring you navigate efficiently, conserve precious resources, and minimize exposure to hazards. A well-planned route is your blueprint for safe passage, guiding you from your current position to your objective with maximum effectiveness and a clear understanding of the challenges ahead.

## Materials Needed

*   **Topographic Map:** The most detailed map available for your region.
*   **Baseplate Compass:** With a clear base, orienting arrow, and declination adjustment.
*   **Pencil and Paper/Notebook:** For marking the map, taking notes, and creating a route card.
*   **Ruler/Straightedge:** For drawing straight lines and measuring distances on the map.
*   **Protractor (optional):** For more precise bearing measurements.
*   **Watch/Timekeeping Device:** To estimate travel time and track progress.
*   **Headlamp/Flashlight:** For map reading in low-light conditions.
*   **First-Aid Kit:** Essential for any journey.
*   **Water and Rations:** Sufficient for the planned journey, plus a buffer.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Define Your Objective and Current Position:** Clearly identify your starting point and your desired destination on the map. Understand *why* you are going there (e.g., water source, shelter, rendezvous point).

2.  **Gather Information and Study the Map:**
    *   **Terrain:** Analyze contour lines to understand elevation changes (steepness, valleys, ridges). Identify flat areas, potential obstacles like cliffs, swamps, or dense forests.
    *   **Water Sources:** Locate rivers, streams, lakes, or springs for potential resupply.
    *   **Obstacles:** Note any impassable features, major roads, or restricted areas.
    *   **Features:** Identify prominent landmarks (peaks, power lines, unique rock formations) that can serve as navigational aids.
    *   **Scale and Declination:** Understand the map's scale (e.g., 1:24,000) and the magnetic declination for your area. Adjust your compass accordingly.

3.  **Identify Potential Routes:** Based on your map study, sketch out several possible paths from your start to your objective. Don't limit yourself to just one initially.

4.  **Evaluate Each Route:** Assess each potential route against these criteria:

TIME/DISTANCE CALCULATION:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Flat terrain:    4-5 km/hr          │
│ Moderate hills:  3-4 km/hr          │
│ Steep/rough:     2-3 km/hr          │
│ Dense bush:      1-2 km/hr          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

NAISMITH'S RULE:
├─ 1 hour per 5km horizontal
└─ +1 hour per 600m climb

MAP READING SEQUENCE:
Orient map → Identify landmarks → Plot route
→ Calculate time → Identify bail-out points
