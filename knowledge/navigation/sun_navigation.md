# Sun Navigation

**Category:** navigation
**Difficulty:** beginner
**Generated:** 2025-11-24

## Overview

Sun navigation is a fundamental wilderness survival skill that enables you to determine direction using the sun's predictable movement across the sky. This ancient technique requires no equipment and works in most weather conditions where the sun is visible. Understanding sun navigation principles provides a critical backup when compasses fail or are unavailable.

## Materials Needed

- **None required** (pure observation)
- Straight stick (for shadow method)
- Two small stones or markers
- Watch (for watch method - optional)
- Clear view of horizon

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Basic Sun Movement Principles

1. **In Northern Hemisphere:**
   - Sun rises in east, sets in west
   - At noon, sun is due south (highest point)
   - Shadows point north at solar noon

2. **In Southern Hemisphere:**
   - Sun rises in east, sets in west
   - At noon, sun is due north (highest point)
   - Shadows point south at solar noon

### Shadow Stick Method

1. **Place vertical stick** in level ground (2-3 feet tall)
2. **Mark shadow tip** with stone (first mark)
3. **Wait 15-20 minutes** for shadow to move
4. **Mark new shadow tip** (second mark)
5. **Draw line** connecting marks = East-West line
   - First mark = West
   - Second mark = East
6. **Stand with left foot on West mark** (Northern Hemisphere)
   - You now face North

### Watch Method (Analog Watch)

**Northern Hemisphere:**
1. Hold watch horizontal, point hour hand at sun
2. Bisect angle between hour hand and 12 o'clock
3. This line points South

**Southern Hemisphere:**
1. Point 12 o'clock at sun
2. Bisect angle between 12 and hour hand
3. This line points North

```

## Safety Considerations

**Critical Warnings:**
- Never stare directly at sun (eye damage)
- Shadow method requires 15+ minutes (plan time)
- Less accurate near equator
- Accuracy ±15° (good for general direction)

**Limitations:**
- Requires visible sun
- Less effective in dense forest canopy
- Seasonal variations affect accuracy
- Watch method requires accurate time setting

**Environmental Ethics:**
- Use natural stick or remove marker after use
- Minimal ground disturbance
- Practice Leave No Trace principles

## Tips & Troubleshooting

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using slanted stick (must be vertical)
- Uneven ground (affects shadow accuracy)
- Too short wait time between marks
- Forgetting hemisphere differences

**Improving Accuracy:**
- Longer stick = clearer shadow
- Level ground = better results
- Wait 30+ minutes for more precision
- Repeat measurements to confirm
- Cross-reference with other navigation methods

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Use multiple sticks for confirmation
- Combine with star navigation at night
- Note sunrise/sunset positions
- Observe moss growth (usually north-facing in Northern Hemisphere)

**Best Practices:**
- Practice in known locations first
- Remember: Shadow stick works anywhere, anytime sun visible
- Mark cardinal directions on ground for camp reference
- Teach method to group members for redundancy
