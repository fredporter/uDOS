# GPS Basics and Backup Methods

**Category:** Navigation
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Generated Date:** 2024-07-29

## Overview

Global Positioning System (GPS) technology has revolutionized navigation, providing unprecedented accuracy in pinpointing your location anywhere on Earth. A GPS receiver, whether a dedicated handheld unit or a smartphone, uses signals from a constellation of satellites to calculate its precise coordinates, speed, and direction. In a survival scenario, GPS can be a powerful tool for finding your way to safety, locating rescue points, or navigating through unfamiliar terrain with speed and efficiency.

However, relying solely on GPS in a wilderness emergency is a critical mistake. GPS devices are electronic and inherently vulnerable to battery depletion, signal loss (in dense tree cover, deep canyons, or severe weather), and mechanical failure. A true survivalist understands that GPS is a valuable *aid*, not a primary navigation system. This guide will cover the basics of using GPS effectively and, more importantly, equip you with the essential backup methods—map, compass, and terrain association—that become your lifeline when technology fails.

## Materials Needed

*   **GPS Device:** A reliable handheld GPS unit or a smartphone with GPS capabilities and offline maps.
*   **Extra Batteries/Power Bank:** Sufficient spare batteries or a fully charged power bank, appropriate for your device. Solar chargers can be useful but are weather-dependent.
*   **Topographic Map:** A current, waterproof topographic map of your entire intended area and surrounding regions.
*   **Baseplate Compass:** A reliable, durable compass with a clear baseplate and, ideally, magnetic declination adjustment.
*   **Notebook/Waterproof Paper:** For recording coordinates, waypoints, and observations.
*   **Pencil/Waterproof Pen:** For making notes.
*   **Map Case/Plastic Bag:** To protect your map and notes from the elements.
*   **Headlamp/Flashlight:** For low-light conditions.
*   **Basic Survival Kit:** Water, food, first aid, fire starter, shelter materials.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. GPS Basics: Operating Your Device

Familiarity with your specific GPS unit is paramount *before* an emergency.

#### 1.1. Understand Coordinate Systems
*   **Latitude/Longitude (Lat/Lon):** Most common format (e.g., 34°05'45" N, 118°15'30" W). Used for global reference.
*   **Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM):** Divides the Earth into zones, providing a grid-based coordinate (e.g., 11S 432100E 3789000N). Excellent for precise local navigation, especially with topographic maps.
*   **Military Grid Reference System (MGRS):** Similar to UTM, often used in military and search & rescue.
*   **Setup:** Configure your GPS device to display coordinates in the system that matches your topographic map (usually UTM or MGRS for land navigation).

#### 1.2. Mark Your Starting Point (Waypoint)
*   **Power On and Acquire Signal:** Ensure your device has a clear view of the sky to acquire satellite signals. Wait for an accurate fix.
*   **Mark Current Location:** Immediately mark your starting point (car, trailhead, camp) as a waypoint. Label it clearly (e.g., "START," "CAR"). This allows you to backtrack if necessary.

#### 1.3. Navigate Using Waypoints
*   **Enter Destination Waypoint:** If you have known coordinates for a destination (e.g., a known shelter, a specific peak), manually enter them.
*   **Follow the Arrow:** Your GPS will typically display an arrow pointing to your next waypoint and the distance remaining. Keep the arrow centered to stay on course.
*   **Track Your Path (Breadcrumbs):** Most GPS units can record your track, leaving a "breadcrumb" trail. This is invaluable for retracing your steps if you get lost or need to return to a previous location. Enable this feature.

#### 1.4. Monitor Key Data
*   **Distance to Destination:** How far you have left to travel.
*   **Bearing/Direction:** The compass direction to your next waypoint.
*   **Speed:** Your current speed of travel.
*   **Elevation:** Your current altitude.
*   **Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA):** Based on your current speed.

### 2. Integrating GPS with Map and Compass (The Golden Rule)

GPS is best used *with* traditional tools, not instead of them.

#### 2.1. Plot Your GPS Position on a Map
*   **Get Coordinates:** Read your precise coordinates from your GPS device.
*   **Locate on Map:** Using the grid lines on your topographic map (which correspond to UTM/MGRS coordinates), plot your GPS position. This confirms where you are in the physical landscape and helps you visualize the terrain around you.
*   **Orient Map:** Once your position is plotted, orient your map to the ground using terrain association or your compass.

#### 2.2. Navigate with Map and Compass, Verify with GPS
*   **Plan Route on Map:** Use your map to identify the best route, noting terrain, obstacles, and potential handrails/catch features.
*   **Set Compass Bearing:** Use your compass to take a bearing from your current position on the map to your next objective.
*   **Travel by Compass:** Navigate primarily using your compass and terrain association.
*   **Periodic GPS Checks:** Every 30-60 minutes, or at significant terrain features, take a GPS reading. Plot this point on your map. Does it match your expected position based on your map and compass navigation? If not, investigate the discrepancy. This cross-referencing helps catch errors early.

### 3. Essential Backup Navigation Methods (When GPS Fails)

Assume your GPS *will* fail. These are your lifelines.

#### 3.1. Map and Compass
*   **Orient the Map:** Place your compass on the map, align the compass's North arrow with the map's North lines (accounting for magnetic declination), and rotate the map until the magnetic needle points North.
*   **Determine Your Position (Resection):**
    1.  Identify two or three known landmarks (on the ground and on the map).
    2.  Take a compass bearing to each landmark *from your location*.
    3.  Convert these to back-bearings (add/subtract 180°).
    4.  Plot these back-bearings on your map. Your position is where they intersect.
*   **Route Planning:** Identify handrails (linear features like ridges or rivers) and catch features (prominent landmarks indicating arrival at a waypoint or destination).

#### 3.2. Dead Reckoning
*   **Calibrate Pace:** Know how many paces (two steps) you take to cover 100 meters on various terrain types.
*   **Track Bearings & Distances:** When traveling, maintain a constant compass bearing and meticulously count your paces. Record each leg (bearing and distance) in your notebook.
*   **Track Time:** Note start and end times for each leg to estimate distance if pacing is difficult.
*   **Account for Deviations:** If forced to detour around an obstacle, measure the bearing and distance of the detour, then resume your original bearing.

#### 3.3. Landmark Identification / Terrain Association
*   **Observe and Recognize:** Continuously scan the horizon and your immediate surroundings for distinctive natural (peaks, valleys, rivers, rock formations) or man-made (buildings, power lines, unique clearings) features.
*   **Sketch and Describe:** Keep a running log of landmarks, noting their appearance, location, and relationship to your path.
*   **Use as Waypoints:** Use identified landmarks to confirm your position, verify your direction, or guide you along a linear path (handrailing).

#### 3.4. Improvised/Celestial Navigation
*   **Sun Compass:** In the Northern Hemisphere, if you point the hour hand of an analog watch at the sun, South will be halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock (or 1 o'clock during daylight savings).
*   **North Star (Polaris):** Locate the Big Dipper and follow its two "pointer" stars to the Little Dipper. Polaris, at the end of the Little Dipper's handle, indicates True North.

## Safety Considerations

*   **Practice, Practice, Practice:** Navigation skills are perishable. Regularly practice using your GPS, map, and compass in varied terrain, not just when an emergency strikes.
*   **Battery Management:** Always start with full batteries and carry adequate spares. Conserve battery life by dimming screens, turning off unnecessary features, and minimizing usage.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Dense tree cover, deep canyons, heavy overcast, or intense electrical storms can degrade GPS signal accuracy or cause complete loss.
*   **Leave a Plan:** Always inform a trusted person of your intended route, destination, and expected return time, including your planned navigation methods.
*   **Prioritize Safety:** If you become disoriented, lost, or face severe weather, prioritize shelter, warmth, water, and safety over pushing forward blindly.
*   **Physical Protection:** Protect your map, compass, and GPS device from water, impact, and extreme temperatures.

## Common Mistakes

*   **Sole Reliance on GPS:** The most dangerous mistake. Always carry and know how to use physical backups.
*   **Ignoring Battery Life:** Running out of power renders your GPS useless.
*   **Lack of Map & Compass Skills:** Having a map and compass but not knowing how to use them effectively is equivalent to not having them.
*   **Incorrect Declination Adjustment:** Failing to adjust your compass for magnetic declination will lead to significant errors when correlating with a map.
*   **Not Orienting the Map:** Trying to use a map without aligning it to the ground is a common cause of disorientation.
*   **Not Marking Your Start Point:** Forgetting to record your initial location can make backtracking impossible.
*   **Inaccurate Coordinate Systems:** Using a different coordinate system on your GPS than your map makes plotting impossible.
*   **No Track Log (Breadcrumbs):** Not enabling the track log feature prevents easy retracing of your steps.
