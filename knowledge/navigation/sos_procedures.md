# SOS Procedures (Navigation)

## Overview
When navigation fails or an emergency renders you incapacitated, knowing how to effectively signal for help is paramount for survival. SOS procedures are standardized methods designed to attract the attention of potential rescuers, whether by air, land, or sea. Mastering these techniques significantly increases your chances of being located and rescued in a distress situation.

## Materials Needed
*   **Signaling mirror:** Essential for reflecting sunlight.
*   **Whistle:** For audible signals; much more effective than shouting.
*   **Brightly colored fabric/panel:** A tarp, ground cloth, or emergency blanket in a contrasting color (orange, red, yellow).
*   **Fire starting materials:** Waterproof matches, lighter, ferro rod, tinder, kindling.
*   **Knife or multi-tool:** For cutting, clearing, and preparing materials.
*   **Flashlight or headlamp:** With fresh batteries, for night signaling.
*   **Natural materials:** Rocks, logs, branches, snow, sand, or anything that contrasts with the ground.
*   **Duct tape or cordage:** For securing materials.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Choose Your Location Wisely
Select an open area with maximum visibility to potential rescuers. This could be a hilltop, a clearing, a beach, or a large open field. Avoid dense tree cover or deep valleys where signals may be obscured. Consider both ground-level and aerial visibility.

### 2. Ground-to-Air Visual Signals (Daytime)
These are large, static signals meant to be seen from aircraft or distant vantage points.
*   **Create a large "SOS" or "X" symbol:** Use contrasting materials like rocks, logs, branches, dark soil, or snow. Each letter or mark should be at least 3 meters (10 feet) long, and preferably 6-10 meters (20-30 feet) long, with sufficient spacing between them to be distinguishable.
    *   *Rocks/Logs:* Arrange them clearly on a contrasting background.
    *   *Snow:* Trample down snow to expose darker ground or use branches to create dark patterns on a snowy surface.
    *   *Fabric/Panels:* Lay out bright tarps or clothes in an "SOS" or "X" pattern. Anchor them with rocks or stakes to prevent wind from disturbing them.
*   **Signal Fires (Smoke Signal):** Build three fires in a triangle pattern, approximately 30 meters (100 feet) apart. This is an international distress signal.
