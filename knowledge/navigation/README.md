## ⚠️ Critical Safety Rules

### Navigation Safety:
- [ ] **Tell someone your route** - File trip plan before departing
- [ ] **Carry backup methods** - Compass + map if using GPS
- [ ] **Know when to STOP** - If lost, stay put (STOP: Sit, Think, Observe, Plan)
- [ ] **Mark your trail** - Use non-permanent markers (biodegradable)
- [ ] **Check weather** - Conditions affect visibility and safety

### When Lost:
- [ ] **STOP immediately** - Don't wander when disoriented
- [ ] **Stay visible** - Open areas for aerial search
- [ ] **Signal regularly** - Whistle every 15 minutes (3 blasts = SOS)
- [ ] **Conserve energy** - Don't panic-run
- [ ] **Hydrate and shelter** - Survival priorities apply

### Signaling Safety:
- [ ] **Mirror signals** - Never aim at aircraft cockpit (blindness risk)
- [ ] **Smoke signals** - Control fire, have water ready
- [ ] **Ground markers** - Use contrast materials, make LARGE (5-10m)
- [ ] **Audio signals** - International: 3 of anything = distress

### Tool Safety:
- [ ] **Trust your compass** - It's right, your gut is wrong
- [ ] **Account for declination** - Magnetic vs true north (can be 20°+ error)
- [ ] **Verify map date** - Terrain changes, old maps mislead
- [ ] **Battery backup** - GPS failure plan mandatory

## 📖 Learning Tips

### Practice Drills:
1. **Sun shadow tracking:** Place stick, mark shadow every hour for a day
2. **Star navigation:** Identify Polaris/Southern Cross monthly for a year
3. **Pace count:** Measure on flat, then uphill, downhill, different terrains
4. **Compass bearing:** Walk to distant object on bearing, measure accuracy
5. **Map reading:** Match topographic map to terrain on every hike

### Skill Maintenance:
- **Monthly:** Practice celestial navigation (stars change seasonally)
- **Quarterly:** Recalibrate pace count (fitness/terrain changes)
- **Annually:** Update knowledge of magnetic declination (shifts over time)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
1. **Trusting gut over compass** - Your sense of direction is often wrong
2. **Ignoring declination** - 15° error = 1.5km off course per 10km traveled
3. **Not practicing pace count** - Uphill/downhill drastically changes it
4. **Waiting until lost to signal** - Start early, rescuers need time
5. **Single method reliance** - Always have backup navigation

### Recommended Progression:
- **Week 1-2:** Daytime sun navigation
- **Week 3-4:** Compass basics
- **Month 2:** Map + compass combined
- **Month 3:** Night navigation with stars
- **Month 4-6:** Dead reckoning over distance
- **6+ months:** Terrain association, advanced techniques

**Real-World Testing:**
- Navigate to known location using only compass + pacing
- Night hike using only stars (clear weather)
- Follow bearing for 1km, verify arrival accuracy
- Plan route on map, hike it, assess accuracy
