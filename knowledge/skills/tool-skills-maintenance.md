# Basic Tool Skills & Maintenance

**Category:** Skills - Practical Knowledge
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Self-sufficiency fundamentals
**Season:** Year-round utility
**Difficulty:** Beginner to Intermediate

---

## Overview

Understanding basic tools and their maintenance enables self-reliance for repairs, projects, and emergencies. These are essential life skills.

**Core principle:** The right tool for the job, properly maintained, makes work safer and easier.

---

## Essential Hand Tools

### Hammer

**Types:**
```
Claw hammer:
├─ General purpose
├─ Driving nails
├─ Pulling nails (claw)
└─ 450-680g weight

Ball-peen hammer:
├─ Metalwork
├─ Shaping metal
└─ 225-450g

Mallet:
├─ Wooden/rubber head
├─ Won't mar surfaces
└─ Chisel work
```

**Proper use:**
1. Grip near end of handle (more power, better control)
2. Let hammer do the work (swing from elbow, not wrist)
3. Look at nail, not hammer
4. Start with gentle taps, then full swings
5. Hold nail near base (if you miss, you hit fingers not thumb)

**Maintenance:**
- Check head is secure (tap handle end on ground)
- Sand handle if rough (prevents blisters)
- Store in dry place (rust prevention)

---

### Screwdrivers

**Types:**
```
Flat/slotted:
├─ Single slot screw
├─ Various widths
└─ Old standard

Phillips (cross):
├─ Most common
├─ Self-centering
└─ Sizes: #1, #2 (most common), #3

Pozidriv:
├─ Similar to Phillips
├─ Better grip
└─ Extra lines between arms

Robertson (square):
├─ Canadian standard
├─ Excellent grip
└─ Color coded by size
```

**Essential sizes:**
- Small (electronics, glasses)
- Medium (general household)
- Large (furniture, heavy duty)

**Proper use:**
1. Match driver to screw exactly (wrong size strips screw)
2. Push in firmly while turning
3. Keep driver perpendicular to screw
4. For tight screws: push hard, turn slowly
5. Clockwise = tighten ("righty-tighty")
6. Counter-clockwise = loosen ("lefty-loosey")

**Maintenance:**
- Keep tips clean and sharp
- Replace if worn (rounded tips slip)
- Magnetic tips help hold screws

---

### Pliers

**Types:**
```
Slip-joint pliers:
├─ General purpose
├─ Adjustable jaw
└─ Two positions

Needle-nose/long-nose:
├─ Tight spaces
├─ Small objects
├─ Wire bending
└─ Often have wire cutters

Locking pliers (Vise-Grip):
├─ Locks onto object
├─ Hands-free grip
└─ Adjustable pressure

Diagonal cutters:
├─ Wire cutting
└─ Flush cuts
```

**Proper use:**
1. Don't use pliers as hammer
2. Don't use on nuts (use wrench - pliers damage)
3. Close to hinge = more gripping power
4. Protect finished surfaces (wrap in cloth)

**Maintenance:**
- Oil pivot point regularly
- Clean jaws
- Don't overtighten locking pliers (damages mechanism)

---

### Wrenches/Spanners

**Types:**
```
Adjustable spanner (Crescent):
├─ Versatile
├─ One tool, many sizes
└─ 200mm and 250mm most useful

Combination wrench:
├─ Open end + box end
├─ Specific sizes
└─ Better grip than adjustable

Socket set:
├─ Ratcheting handle
├─ Various socket sizes
├─ Metric and imperial
└─ Extensions for reach
```

**Proper use:**
1. Pull toward you (safer than pushing)
2. Adjustable: movable jaw should face direction of turning
3. Use correct size (loose wrench rounds nuts)
4. Tap tight nuts with hammer to break seal
5. Penetrating oil for rusted nuts

**Maintenance:**
- Keep clean and oiled
- Store organized (sockets in order)
- Don't use as hammer

---

### Measuring & Marking

**Tape measure:**
```
Essential:
├─ 5m or 8m length
├─ 25mm wide blade (stands out)
├─ Locking mechanism
└─ Metric markings
```

**Tips:**
- Hook slides slightly (compensates for thickness when inside/outside measuring)
- Mark with V (point shows exact measurement)
- Measure twice, cut once
- For long measurements, use helper or hook on nail

**Try square:**
- Check right angles
- Mark perpendicular lines
- Align cuts

**Spirit level:**
- Check horizontal (level)
- Check vertical (plumb)
- Clean glass vials (bubbles should move freely)

**Chalk line:**
- Long straight lines
- Snap against surface
- Re-chalk every few uses

---

### Saws

**Hand saws:**
```
Panel saw:
├─ General wood cutting
├─ 500-650mm blade
└─ Cross-cut or rip-cut teeth

Hacksaw:
├─ Metal cutting
├─ Replaceable blades
├─ Tension adjustment
└─ 18-32 teeth per inch

Coping saw:
├─ Curves and shapes
├─ Thin blade
└─ Tight turns
```

**Proper sawing:**
1. Start cut with thumb guiding blade
2. Long, smooth strokes (full blade length)
3. Let saw do work (don't force)
4. Support wood both sides of cut (prevents binding)
5. For cross-cutting: 45° angle
6. For rip-cutting: 60° angle

**Maintenance:**
- Keep teeth sharp (file or replace)
- Clean pitch/resin from blade
- Store protected (blade guards or hanging)
- Hacksaw: ensure blade tight, teeth facing forward

---

### Chisels

**Types:**
```
Bevel-edge chisel:
├─ General purpose
├─ 6mm, 12mm, 19mm, 25mm common
└─ Wood joints, shaping

Mortise chisel:
├─ Heavy duty
├─ Deep cuts
└─ Lever action
```

**Proper use:**
1. Cut away from body
2. Hand behind cutting edge
3. Small cuts (better control)
4. Mallet for striking (not hammer)
5. Bevel down for paring, bevel up for chopping

**Maintenance:**
- Keep SHARP (dull chisel slips, dangerous)
- Hone on stone regularly
- Protect edges (leather sheath or rack)
- Never use as screwdriver or pry bar

---

### Planes

**Block plane:**
- Small, one-handed
- Smoothing edges
- End grain
- Chamfers

**Jack plane:**
- General smoothing
- Two-handed
- Flattening surfaces

**Proper use:**
1. Plane with grain (not against)
2. Continuous, overlapping strokes
3. Check blade is sharp and set correctly
4. Light cuts (multiple passes better than one heavy)

**Maintenance:**
- Keep blade sharp
- Adjust blade depth (should barely protrude)
- Oil moving parts
- Retract blade when storing

---
