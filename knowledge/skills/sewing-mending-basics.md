## Threading a Needle

**Method:**

2. Thread needle
   ├─ Moisten thread end slightly
   ├─ Hold needle up to light
   ├─ Push thread through eye
   ├─ Pull through 10-15cm
   └─ Needle threader helps (wire loop method)

3. Knot end
   ├─ Wrap thread around finger
   ├─ Roll off finger
   ├─ Pull tight
   └─ Should make small knot
```

**Double thread** (stronger):
- Thread needle
- Pull thread halfway through
- Tie both ends together
- Now have double thickness

## Basic Stitches

### Running Stitch

**Use:** Gathering, basting, quick repairs

```
Method:
├─ In and out of fabric
├─ Even spacing

## Sewing Machine Basics

**Parts:**
```

```

**Threading:**
1. Follow diagram on machine
2. Thread through all guides
3. Through needle eye
4. Wind bobbin
5. Insert bobbin in case
6. Pull thread up through plate

**Starting:**
1. Place fabric under presser foot
2. Lower foot
3. Gentle pressure on pedal
4. Guide fabric (don't pull or push)
5. Backstitch at start and end (reverse lever)

**Common problems:**
- Thread bunching: check tension, bobbin
- Needle breaking: wrong needle, fabric too thick, pulling fabric
- Skipped stitches: blunt needle, wrong needle type
- Won't sew: bobbin empty, threading wrong

## Fabric Care

### Before Sewing

```
├─ Pre-wash fabric (prevents shrinking later)
├─ Iron smooth
├─ Cut along grain (fabric direction)
└─ Pin pattern pieces carefully
```

### After Sewing

```
├─ Press seams (iron)
├─ Clip threads
├─ Turn right-side out
└─ Final press
```

### Storage

```
├─ Fold neatly (prevents wrinkles)
├─ Keep dry (mold prevention)
├─ Moths like natural fibers (cedar, lavender)
└─ Repair before storing (damage spreads)
```

## Tips & Tricks

**Threading needle easier:**
- Cut thread at angle
- Moisten slightly (not too wet)
- Hold needle against white background
- Use needle threader

**Prevent knots:**
- Don't use too-long thread
- Wax thread (beeswax or thread conditioner)
- Pull thread through thread spool first

**Keep stitches even:**
- Mark stitch length with ruler first
- Practice makes perfect
- Machine is more even than hand

**Stop fabric from slipping:**
- Pin perpendicular to seam
- Iron seam first
- Use clips instead of pins (thick fabric)

**Sharpen scissors:**
- Cut through sandpaper (fine grit)
- Or cut aluminum foil (several layers)
- Professional sharpening for important scissors
