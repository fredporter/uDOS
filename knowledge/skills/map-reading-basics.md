# Map Reading Basics

**Category:** Skills — Navigation
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Time:** 10-30 minutes

---

## Overview

Maps compress terrain into symbols. Master a few basics and you can navigate safely without digital tools.

## Compass Rose (Simple)

```
        N
        ↑
    W ← + → E
        ↓
        S
```

---

## Contour Lines (Terrain Shape)

```
Hill:                    Saddle:
  ____                    __    __
 /    \                  /  \__/  \
/      \                /          \
```

---

## Key Concepts

- **Contour lines**: Close together = steep; far apart = gentle.
- **Ridges**: Contours form elongated ovals.
- **Valleys**: Contours form V-shapes pointing uphill.
- **Scale**: Measure distance (e.g., 1:25,000 = 1 cm = 250 m).

## Navigation Flowchart

```diagram flowchart
START: Orient map to north
STEP: Identify current position using landmarks
STEP: Determine destination bearing
STEP: Plan route with ridges/valleys in mind
STEP: Use handrails (rivers, roads, ridgelines)
STEP: Check off features as you move
END: Confirm arrival and re-orient map
```

## Quick Terrain Sketch

```

  ---======---            ---\\//---
  --========--            --\\//--
```

## Practice Exercise

1. Find a local map (park, trail, or topo map).
2. Mark 3 landmarks you can see.
3. Draw the bearing between two points.
4. Walk the route while checking contours.
