# Solar Still Construction

**Category:** water
**Difficulty:** beginner
**Generated:** 2025-11-27

## Overview

A solar still uses sunlight to evaporate and condense water, producing clean drinking water from contaminated sources or vegetation. This passive purification method requires no fuel and can produce 1-2 liters per day in good conditions.

Solar stills are ideal for desert environments with abundant sunlight but limited water. They work through the greenhouse effect: heat causes water to evaporate, leaving contaminants behind, then condensation collects on a clear surface.

## Materials Needed

- **Clear plastic sheet** (1.8m x 1.8m minimum) - polyethylene or similar
- **Digging tool** - shovel, knife, or sharp stick
- **Collection container** - cup, bottle, or waterproof bag
- **Drinking tube** (optional) - flexible straw or small hose
- **Rock or weight** - fist-sized, smooth and clean
- **Vegetation** (optional) - green leaves, cacti, succulents for moisture

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Site Selection
Choose location carefully:
- **Full sun exposure** - 6+ hours direct sunlight
- **Level ground** - easier to dig, better seal
- **Moist soil** - indicates subsurface water
- **Near vegetation** - additional moisture source
- **Protected from wind** - prevents plastic lifting

Avoid rocky or root-filled areas that make digging difficult.

### Step 2: Dig the Pit
Create the evaporation chamber:
- Dig hole **60-90cm diameter, 45cm deep**
- Make sides smooth and angled (cone shape)
- Keep dug soil nearby for sealing edges
- Place collection container in center bottom
- Ensure container is stable and level

**Pro tip:** Dig in early morning before heat peaks.

### Step 3: Add Moisture Sources
Maximize water production:
- **Vegetation:** Place green leaves around container (not touching)
- **Contaminated water:** Pour around edges (avoid splashing into container)
- **Urine:** Can be used if desperate (pour at edges only)
- **Moisture-rich soil:** Add if available

Leave 10-15cm space around collection container.

### Step 4: Cover and Seal
Create the condensation surface:
- Spread plastic sheet over entire pit
- Center carefully over collection container
- Anchor edges with dug soil (20-30cm wide berm)
- Ensure complete seal - no gaps
- Press soil firmly to prevent air leaks

### Step 5: Create Condensation Point
- Place fist-sized rock in center of plastic
- Position directly above collection container
- Create 30-45° slope from edges to center
- Rock should depress plastic 10-15cm
- Ensure plastic doesn't touch container

### Step 6: Insert Drinking Tube (Optional)
If you have tubing:
- Place one end in collection container
- Thread other end under plastic edge
- Seal around tube with soil
- Allows drinking without disturbing still

### Step 7: Wait and Monitor
- Takes 2-4 hours to start producing water
- Peak production during midday heat
- Can produce 0.5-2 liters per 24 hours
- Don't disturb plastic - breaks seal
- Check every 12-24 hours

## Expected Output

**First 24 hours:** 0.5-1 liter in good conditions
**Peak efficiency:** Day 2-3 (soil fully saturated)
**Declining production:** After 3-4 days (moisture depleted)

In optimal conditions (desert, full sun, green vegetation):
- 1-2 liters per day possible
- In poor conditions (cloudy, limited moisture):
- 0.25-0.5 liters per day

## Improving Efficiency

**Multiple stills:** Build 2-3 for better output
**Reflective surfaces:** Aluminum foil around edges increases heat
**Black plastic bottom:** Absorbs more heat (if available)
**Regular relocation:** Move every 3-4 days to fresh soil
**Vegetation replacement:** Add fresh plant material daily

## Safety Considerations

- **Water quality:** Still purifies but doesn't remove all chemicals
- **Heat stroke:** Dig during cooler hours
- **Dehydration:** Don't rely solely on still - find other sources too
- **Plastic fumes:** Avoid colored or printed plastic (toxins)
- **Wildlife:** Cover holes when abandoned (animals can fall in)

## Common Mistakes

- **Plastic touching container:** Water drips back into soil, not container
- **Poor seal:** Air leaks reduce efficiency drastically
- **Disturbing too often:** Breaks seal, releases accumulated vapor
- **Too shallow:** Reduces evaporation volume
- **Wrong location:** Shade reduces production by 80%+
- **No weight:** Plastic blows around, condensation doesn't collect

## Troubleshooting

**No water after 4 hours:**
- Check seal integrity
- Verify plastic slopes to center
- Ensure adequate moisture source
- Check if container is positioned correctly

**Very little production:**
- Add more vegetation
- Relocate to sunnier spot
- Dig deeper for moist soil
- Check for air leaks
