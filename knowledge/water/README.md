# Water Procurement & Purification

**Category:** Water | **Target:** 150 guides | **Current:** 26 guides (17.3%)

Finding, purifying, and storing water safely in all environments.

---

## Critical Priority

Water is a top survival priority:
- **Rule of 3s**: 3 days without water (average)
- **Daily Needs**: 2-3 liters minimum per person
- **Purification Required**: Assume all natural water is contaminated
