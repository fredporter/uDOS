# Water Quality Testing

## Overview
Assessing water quality is a critical step in survival, even after purification, to ensure it's safe for consumption. While advanced lab tests are impossible in the field, basic sensory and visual inspections, combined with simple field tests, can provide vital clues about potential contaminants. This guide outlines practical methods to evaluate water sources before drinking.

## Materials Needed
*   **Clear Container:** A transparent glass, plastic bottle, or jar (at least 1-2 cups capacity).
*   **White Background:** A clean piece of white cloth, paper, or the inside of a light-colored container.
*   **Light Source:** Natural daylight is ideal; a flashlight or headlamp can assist in low-light conditions.
*   **pH Test Strips (Optional but Recommended):** Basic litmus paper or universal pH strips.
*   **Clean Nose and Eyes:** Your primary sensory tools.
*   **Clean Mouth/Taste Buds:** To be used *only* as a final, cautious check after all other tests and purification steps.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Visual Inspection (Turbidity & Color):**
    *   **Collect Sample:** Fill your clear container with water from the source.
    *   **Observe Clarity:** Hold the container against your white background in good light. Look through the water. Is it clear, cloudy, murky, or does it have suspended particles?
    *   **Check Color:** Note any unusual coloration – yellow, brown, green, or black.
    *   *Interpretation:* Clear, colorless water is preferred. Cloudiness (turbidity) indicates suspended solids, silt, clay, or microorganisms. Any unnatural color suggests organic or chemical contamination.

2.  **Sediment Check:**
    *   **Settle Time:** Place the collected water sample on a stable surface and let it sit undisturbed for at least 15-30 minutes (longer if very cloudy).
    *   **Observe Sedimentation:** Carefully observe the bottom of the container for any settled particles.
    *   *Interpretation:* Significant sediment means the water requires thorough filtration before purification to remove particulate matter.

3.  **Odor Test:**
    *   **Swirl and Sniff:** Gently swirl the water in the container, then bring it close to your nose and sniff carefully.
    *   **Identify Smells:** Note any distinct odors:
        *   **Rotten Eggs:** (Hydrogen sulfide) Often indicates decaying organic matter or anaerobic bacterial activity.
        *   **Chemical/Chlorine:** Suggests industrial runoff or treated water (if unexpected).
        *   **Metallic:** Can indicate mineral content or heavy metals.
        *   **Fishy/Earthy/Moldy:** Often from algae or decaying organic matter.
        *   **Sewage:** A strong indicator of human or animal waste contamination.
    *   *Interpretation:* Any strong or unpleasant odor is a major warning sign. Water should ideally be odorless.

4.  **Surface Film Observation:**
    *   **Examine Surface:** Look closely at the water's surface in the container and, if possible, at the source itself.
    *   **Identify Films:** Are there any oily sheens, iridescent films (like gasoline on water), or persistent foam?
    *   *Interpretation:* Oily sheens or rainbow-like films strongly suggest petroleum products or chemical pollutants. Foaming can indicate detergents or industrial waste.

5.  **pH Test (If Materials Available):**
    *   **Dip Strip:** Follow the instructions for your pH test strips. Typically, you dip the strip into the water for a few seconds.
