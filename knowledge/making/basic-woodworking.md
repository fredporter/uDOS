## Understanding Timber

### Hardwood vs Softwood

**Softwood** (from conifers/pine trees):

```
Common in Australia:
├─ Radiata Pine (plantation, cheap, common)
├─ Cypress Pine (termite resistant)
└─ Hoop Pine (Queensland)

Characteristics:
├─ Generally lighter, softer
├─ Easier to work (cut, nail)
├─ Less expensive
├─ Good for framing, general projects
├─ Can dent/damage more easily
└─ Needs treatment for outdoor use

Best for:
├─ Learning (forgiving, cheap)
├─ Indoor furniture
├─ Framing
└─ Painted projects
```

---

**Hardwood** (from broad-leaf trees):

```
Common Australian hardwoods:
├─ Spotted Gum (durable, outdoor decking)
├─ Blackbutt (strong, flooring, decking)
├─ Jarrah (WA, very hard, outdoor)
├─ Tasmanian Oak (actually eucalyptus, furniture)
├─ Red Gum (durable, heavy)
└─ Ironbark (extremely hard, posts)

Characteristics:
├─ Harder, denser
├─ More expensive
├─ Naturally more durable (weather, termites)
├─ Beautiful grain (if finished well)
├─ Harder to work (tough on tools)
└─ Often no treatment needed (outdoor)

Best for:
├─ Outdoor furniture
├─ Decking
├─ Fine furniture (when grain matters)
└─ Long-lasting projects
```

---

### Treated vs Untreated

```
╔════════════════════╦═══════════════════════════════╗
║ TYPE              ║ USE                           ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ Untreated Pine    ║ Indoor only                   ║
║                   ║ Will rot outdoors             ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ H2 Treated        ║ Indoor, protected outdoors    ║

║                   ║ (jetties, etc.)               ║
╚════════════════════╩═══════════════════════════════╝

Note: Treated pine has chemicals (CCA = copper/chrome/arsenic, ACQ = copper/ammonia)
├─ Wear mask when cutting (don't breathe dust)
├─ Wash hands after handling
├─ Don't burn offcuts (toxic smoke)
└─ Not for food surfaces (cutting boards, etc.)
```

### Timber Sizing (Australian)

**Nominal vs Actual sizes:**

```
Dressed timber (DAR = Dressed All Round) is smaller than nominal:

╔════════════════════╦═══════════════════════════════╗
║ NOMINAL SIZE      ║ ACTUAL SIZE (approx)          ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ 100mm × 50mm      ║ 90mm × 45mm                   ║
║ (4×2)             ║                               ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ 150mm × 50mm      ║ 140mm × 45mm                  ║
║ (6×2)             ║                               ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ 100mm × 100mm     ║ 90mm × 90mm                   ║
║ (4×4)             ║                               ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ 200mm × 50mm      ║ 190mm × 45mm                  ║
║ (8×2)             ║                               ║
╚════════════════════╩═══════════════════════════════╝

Planing/dressing removes material.
Always measure actual size, don't assume nominal.

## Essential Techniques

### Measuring & Marking

**"Measure twice, cut once"**

```
Best practices:
├─ Use same tape measure throughout project (they vary slightly)
├─ Mark with V pointing to exact line (not just line)
├─ Pencil for rough, knife for precision
├─ Square everything (check 90°)
└─ Mark waste side with X (don't cut on wrong side!)

Marking example:
    │← Waste (X)  │  Keep →│
    ├─────────────▼─────────┤
                  ↑
              Cut here
              (just outside line, sand to line)
```

---

### Cutting Straight

**Hand saw technique:**

```
1. Mark line clearly (square across)
2. Secure work (clamp or vise, both hands free)
3. Start cut:
   ├─ Thumb against side of saw (guide)
   ├─ Short backstroke (establish groove)
   ├─ Gentle pressure (saw does work)
   └─ 45° angle to work
4. Continue:
   ├─ Long smooth strokes (full blade length)
   ├─ Let saw do work (don't force)
   ├─ Support both sides of cut near end (prevent splitting)
   └─ Slow at end (control)

Tips:
├─ Coarse teeth (8-10 per inch) = rough/fast
├─ Fine teeth (12-16 per inch) = smooth/slow
├─ Cut on waste side (can sand to line)
└─ Practice on scrap first
```

---

**Circular saw technique:**

```
Safety first:
├─ ALWAYS wear safety glasses
├─ Clamp work securely (both hands on saw)
├─ Check blade guard working
├─ Unplug when changing blade
├─ No loose clothing/jewelry
└─ Full speed before entering wood

Cutting:
1. Mark line with square
2. Set blade depth (3-5mm deeper than timber thickness)
3. Align blade with waste side of line
4. Start saw away from wood (full speed)
5. Enter cut smoothly
6. Push steadily (don't force)
7. Support both sides of cut
8. Let blade stop completely before lifting

Straight cuts:
└─ Clamp straightedge as guide (saw base runs along it)
```

---

### Drilling

**Preventing splits and mess:**

```
Pilot holes (before screwing):
├─ Prevents splitting (especially near edge)
├─ Drill bit slightly smaller than screw shank
├─ Depth = screw length (or tape marker on bit)
└─ Especially important in hardwood

Countersinking (screw head flush):
├─ Countersink bit creates taper
├─ Screw head sits flush or below surface
└─ Can plug hole after (dowel, timber plug)

Clean holes:
├─ Clamp backing board (prevents tear-out on exit)
├─ Drill from both sides if thick (meet in middle)
├─ Slow speed for large bits (less heat, cleaner)
├─ Clear chips regularly (back bit out while spinning)
└─ Sharp bits essential (dull = burning, tear-out)
```

---

### Planing

**Creating smooth, flat surfaces:**

```
Plane setup:
├─ Blade sharp (essential!)
├─ Slight protrusion (thin shaving, not thick chip)
├─ Check sole flat (base of plane)
└─ Adjust depth with knob

Technique:
1. Secure work (vise or clamps)
2. Plane WITH grain (direction fibers run)
3. Pressure:
   ├─ Start: press front of plane
   ├─ Middle: even pressure
   ├─ End: press back of plane
   └─ Keeps plane flat, prevents rounding ends
4. Overlapping strokes
5. Check progress (straight edge, winding sticks)

Against grain = tear-out (fibers lift, rough surface)
With grain = smooth shaving
```

---

### Chiseling

**Controlled material removal:**

```
Types of cuts:
├─ Paring (hand pressure, fine control)
├─ Chopping (mallet, removing waste)
└─ Trimming (cleaning up joints)

Safety:
├─ ALWAYS cut away from body
├─ Hand behind blade (never in front)
├─ Sharp chisel (dull slips = dangerous)
├─ Secure work
└─ Controlled force (especially with mallet)

Paring technique:
1. Hold chisel in one hand (bevel down)
2. Other hand on back (guides and pushes)
3. Slice, don't force
4. Bevel acts as ramp (controls depth)

Chopping (removing waste):
1. Mark waste clearly
2. Series of cuts (5-10mm apart)
3. Chisel vertical (mallet strikes)
4. Break out waste
5. Pare to final line
```

---

### Sanding

**The finishing process:**

```
Grit progression:
├─ 80 grit: Rough shaping, removing material
├─ 120 grit: Smoothing, removing 80 grit scratches
├─ 180 grit: Fine smoothing
├─ 240+ grit: Final finish (before staining/finishing)
└─ Don't skip grits (120→240 still shows 120 scratches)

Technique:
├─ Sand WITH grain (across grain = visible scratches)
├─ Even pressure (prevent dips)
├─ Change paper when clogged (loading up = scratch marks)
├─ Dust extraction/mask (fine dust is harmful)
└─ Check progress (feel surface, raking light)

Power sander:
├─ Random orbital best for flat surfaces
├─ Let tool do work (don't press hard)
├─ Keep moving (pause = dip)
└─ Same grit progression
```

---

## Joints & Fastening

### Simple Joints for Beginners

**Butt Joint** (simplest):

```
    Board A
    ║║║║║║
    ║║║║║║  ← End grain
    ═══════
         ║║║║║║ Board B
         ║║║║║║

Fastening options:
├─ Screws (pilot hole essential)
├─ Nails (can split, less strong)
├─ Dowels (hidden, stronger)
├─ Biscuits (need biscuit joiner)
└─ Glue (not strong alone on end grain)

Reinforce:
├─ Corner braces (metal brackets)
├─ Pocket holes (Kreg jig)
└─ L-shaped support blocks inside
```

---

**Half-Lap Joint** (stronger):

```
    ═══════╗
           ║  ← Half thickness removed from each
    ╔══════║
    ║      ║

Strength: Good (long grain to long grain glue surface)
Use: Frames, crossing pieces
Fastening: Glue + screw/nail
```

---

**Dado/Housing Joint**:

```
    ║║║║║║║
    ╠═════╣  ← Groove cut
    ║     ║
    ║ ═══ ║  ← Shelf fits in groove

Strength: Very good (shelf supported, can't sag)
Use: Bookshelves, cabinets
Requires: Router or dado blade
```

---

### Screws vs Nails vs Glue

```
╔════════════════════╦═══════════════════════════════╗
║ FASTENER          ║ BEST FOR                      ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ Wood Screws       ║ Strong, reversible, most uses ║
║                   ║ Use pilot holes!              ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ Nails             ║ Quick, framing, hidden        ║
║                   ║ (lost head/brad nails)        ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ PVA Glue          ║ Interior, long grain to long  ║
║ (Aquadhere, etc.) ║ Stronger than wood itself!    ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ Outdoor Glue      ║ Exterior, water resistant     ║
║ (Gorilla, etc.)   ║ More expensive                ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ Epoxy             ║ Permanent, gap-filling        ║
║                   ║ Difficult to clamp (runny)    ║
╚════════════════════╩═══════════════════════════════╝

---

## Finishing

### Surface Preparation

**Critical for good finish:**

```
1. Fill defects
   ├─ Wood filler for holes/dents
   ├─ Overfill slightly (shrinks when dry)
   ├─ Sand flush when dry
   └─ Match color to timber or finish

2. Final sanding
   ├─ 180 grit minimum (240 for staining)
   ├─ Remove ALL dust (tack cloth or damp rag)
   ├─ Check with raking light (shows imperfections)
   └─ Don't skip this (finish highlights flaws)

3. Grain raising (optional but good):
   ├─ Dampen with water (spray/wipe)
   ├─ Let dry completely
   ├─ Light sand (220 grit)
   └─ Raises grain fibers, removing prevents roughness after finish
```

---

### Finish Options

║                   ║ Traditional, repairable       ║
╚════════════════════╩═══════════════════════════════╝

Application:
├─ Brush (smooth, even strokes with grain)
├─ Cloth (oil finishes, wipe on/off)
├─ Spray (even, professional, needs ventilation/equipment)
└─ Follow product instructions (coats, dry time, sanding between)
```

---

**Paint:**

```
Steps:
1. Prime (especially pine - prevents resin bleed)
2. Sand lightly (180-220 grit)
3. First coat (thin, even)
4. Dry completely
5. Light sand (220 grit, smooth raised grain)
6. Second coat
7. Optional third coat (high-traffic)

Types:
├─ Water-based (low odor, easy cleanup, most common)
├─ Oil-based (very durable, longer dry, yellows)
└─ Chalk paint (shabby chic, no prep needed but seal with wax)

Outdoor:
└─ Exterior paint or stain (UV and water resistant)
```

---

## Safety Reminders

**ALWAYS:**

```
├─ Safety glasses (sawdust/chips in eyes = permanent damage)
├─ Dust mask (fine sawdust = respiratory issues long-term)
├─ Hearing protection (power tools damage hearing)
├─ Secure work (clamp, don't hold while cutting)
├─ Sharp tools (dull tools slip, need more force = injury)
├─ Clear workspace (trip hazards)
├─ Unplug before changing blades/bits
├─ No loose clothing/jewelry near moving parts
├─ First aid kit accessible
└─ Know your limits (if unsure, research or ask expert)

Treated timber:
├─ Mask when cutting (toxic dust)
├─ Wash hands before eating
└─ Never burn offcuts (toxic smoke)
```

## Buying Timber (Australian)

### Where to Buy

```
Bunnings/Hardware stores:
├─ Convenient, standard sizes
├─ OK quality (select boards, some warped)
├─ More expensive per volume
├─ Good for small projects, beginner
└─ Check each board (sight along edge for twist/warp)

Timber yards:
├─ Better prices (bulk)
├─ More variety (species, sizes)
├─ Can custom mill
├─ Better quality (often)
└─ Minimum orders sometimes

Recycling yards:
├─ Character timber (old flooring, beams)
├─ Cheaper (sometimes free)
├─ Already seasoned/dry
├─ May have nails/defects (check carefully)
└─ Unique look

Cost examples (2025, rough guide):
├─ Pine 90×45mm DAR: $8-12 per meter
├─ Pine 140×19mm decking: $6-10 per meter
├─ Treated H3 90×45: $10-15 per meter
└─ Hardwood varies widely ($15-50+ per meter depending on species)

### Selecting Boards

**What to look for:**

```
Checks (cracks):
├─ Small checks OK (ends, surface)
├─ Large through-checks = weak, avoid
└─ Can cut off checked ends

Knots:
├─ Small tight knots = OK (character)
├─ Large knots = weak point
├─ Loose/missing knots = hole (can fix with dowel)
└─ Knots near edge = may split

Warp:
├─ Sight down board edge (twist/bow visible)
├─ Slight bow OK (can clamp flat)
├─ Severe twist = avoid
└─ Can plane flat if skills/tools allow

Moisture:
├─ Should be kiln-dried (KD) or well-seasoned
├─ Wet timber shrinks, warps when drying
├─ Touch test (wet feels cool/damp)
└─ Store indoors before use (acclimate to environment)
```

## Troubleshooting

**Splits when screwing:**
- Pilot hole too small or missing
- Screw too close to edge (move in 20mm)
- Hardwood needs larger pilot hole

**Saw wandering off line:**
- Dull blade (sharpen or replace)
- Not starting straight (careful start)
- Too much pressure (let saw do work)
- Blade bent (replace)

**Tear-out when planing:**
- Planing against grain (reverse direction)
- Blade dull (sharpen)
- Blade too deep (lighter cut)
- Difficult grain (take lighter passes at angle)

**Glue not holding:**
- End grain (use dowels, screws, or more surface area)
- Surfaces not clean (dust prevents bond)
- Not enough clamp pressure
- Didn't let fully cure (24 hours minimum)

**Finish looks blotchy:**
- Didn't sand enough (start over, sand more)
- Pine staining uneven (pre-treat with wood conditioner)
- Applied too thick (thin coats better)
- Didn't stir finish (pigment settled)

**Key Principles:**

1. **Measure twice, cut once.** Mistakes are wasteful and frustrating.
2. **Sharp tools are safe tools.** Dull tools slip and require excessive force.
3. **Start simple.** Shelf before table, table before cabinet.
4. **Mistakes are learning.** Every woodworker has made thousands.
5. **Safety is not optional.** Eyes, lungs, ears, fingers - you only get one set.
