# Water Collection Systems

**Category:** Making - Water Infrastructure
**Priority:** HIGH - Essential resource
**Season:** Year-round, critical in dry periods
**Difficulty:** Beginner to Intermediate

---

## Overview

Collecting and storing water is crucial for self-reliance, garden irrigation, and emergency preparedness. Australia's variable rainfall makes water collection systems especially valuable.

**Benefits:**
- Reduces mains water use
- Free water for gardens
- Emergency supply
- Reduces stormwater runoff
- Can save $100s per year

**Legal:** Check local regulations (most areas encourage rainwater collection, some require tank installation for new homes)

---

## Rainfall Calculations

### How Much Water Can You Collect?

**Formula:**
```
Roof Area (m²) × Rainfall (mm) × 0.8 (efficiency) = Litres collected

Example:
100m² roof × 50mm rainfall × 0.8 = 4,000 litres from one storm
```

**Efficiency factor (0.8 = 80%):**
- Accounts for evaporation
- Splash/overflow
- First-flush diversion
- Gutter overflow in heavy rain

---

### Australian Rainfall Context

**Annual averages** (highly variable):

```
╔════════════════════╦═══════════════════════════════╗
║ REGION            ║ AVERAGE ANNUAL RAINFALL       ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ Darwin (Top End)  ║ 1,700mm (summer wet season)   ║
║ Cairns (Tropics)  ║ 2,000mm (summer wet)          ║
║ Brisbane          ║ 1,200mm (summer peaks)        ║
║ Sydney            ║ 1,200mm (year-round)          ║
║ Melbourne         ║ 650mm (winter peaks)          ║
║ Adelaide          ║ 550mm (winter peaks)          ║
║ Perth             ║ 730mm (winter peaks)          ║
║ Hobart            ║ 625mm (year-round)            ║
║ Alice Springs     ║ 280mm (highly variable)       ║
╚════════════════════╩═══════════════════════════════╝
```

**Key point:** One storm can provide weeks/months of water if captured properly

## Basic Rain Barrel System

### Components

```
1. Collection surface (roof)
   └─ Existing roof - free!

2. Gutters
   └─ Most homes have these

3. Downpipe
   └─ Directs water from roof

4. First-flush diverter (recommended)
   └─ Discards first dirty water

5. Rain barrel/tank
   └─ Storage container

6. Overflow
   └─ Where water goes when full

7. Tap
   └─ Access stored water
```

---

### DIY Rain Barrel (Budget: $50-150)

**Materials:**

```
Base:
├─ Food-grade barrel/drum (200-250L)
│  └─ Source: food processing, olive oil, industrial (clean well)
├─ OR new plastic drum (~$50-100)
└─ OR repurposed IBC (1000L) container (~$100-150)

Fittings:
├─ Brass tap (~$10-20)
├─ Bulkhead fitting or tank connector (~$5-10)
├─ Mesh screen (keep mosquitoes out) (~$5)
├─ Downpipe connector (~$10-20)
├─ Overflow hose/pipe (~$10)
└─ Teflon tape, silicone sealant

Stand:
├─ Cinder blocks OR
├─ Timber frame OR
└─ Concrete blocks
```

---

### Construction Steps

**1. Prepare barrel:**

```
├─ Clean thoroughly (hot water, detergent, rinse well)
├─ Remove any labels/residue
├─ Check for cracks/leaks
└─ Ensure food-safe (no chemicals previously)
```

**2. Cut inlet hole (top):**

```
├─ Measure downpipe diameter
├─ Mark hole on barrel lid/top
├─ Cut with hole saw (or jigsaw)
├─ Slightly smaller than downpipe (tight fit)
└─ Smooth rough edges
```

**3. Install tap (bottom):**

```
├─ Mark position (5-10cm from bottom)
├─ Drill hole (size for bulkhead fitting)
├─ Insert bulkhead/tank connector from inside
├─ Screw tap onto outside thread
├─ Use Teflon tape on threads
├─ Seal with silicone (inside and outside)
├─ Let cure 24 hours
└─ Test for leaks
```

**4. Add overflow (top or side):**

```
├─ Cut hole near top (below inlet)
├─ Install bulkhead fitting
├─ Attach hose/pipe (directs overflow away)
├─ Angle downward
└─ Run to garden, drain, or second barrel
```

**5. Add screens:**

```
├─ Cover inlet hole with mesh
├─ Prevents mosquitoes, debris
├─ Secure with wire or cable ties
└─ Overflow should also have mesh
```

**6. Build stand:**

```
Why elevate?
├─ Gravity pressure (higher = better flow)
├─ Easy to fit watering can under tap
├─ Easier to attach hose
└─ 30-60cm height ideal

Options:
├─ Stack 2-3 cinder blocks
├─ Build simple timber frame
├─ Use existing structure (deck, etc.)
└─ Ensure level and stable (200L = 200kg)
```

**7. Connect to downpipe:**

```
├─ Position barrel under downpipe
├─ Cut downpipe at appropriate height
├─ Install downpipe diverter OR
├─ Direct pipe into barrel inlet
├─ Seal connections
└─ Ensure tight fit (or water escapes)
```

---

### First-Flush Diverter

**Purpose:** First rain washes roof → bird droppings, dust, leaves → dirty water

**DIY version:**

```
Materials:
├─ PVC pipe (90mm diameter, 60-90cm long)
├─ PVC cap (for bottom)
├─ Small ball (ping pong or similar)
├─ T-junction fitting
└─ Small release valve or drilled hole

Assembly:
├─ Install T-junction in downpipe
├─ Vertical pipe diverts first water downward
├─ Ball floats up as pipe fills
├─ Blocks further flow down
├─ Clean water now goes to barrel
├─ Drain plug at bottom (empty after each storm)

Alternatively:
├─ Simple manual version: Just disconnect downpipe for first minute
├─ Reconnect once water runs clear
└─ Low-tech but effective
```

---

## Linking Multiple Barrels

**Increase storage without huge expense:**

### Series Connection (Overflow Method)

```
Barrel 1 → Overflow → Barrel 2 → Overflow → Barrel 3
   ↑                                              ↓
Downpipe                                      To garden

Advantages:
├─ Simple
├─ Self-regulating (fills first barrel, then next)
├─ Easy to add more
└─ Each barrel can have own tap

Disadvantages:
├─ Barrels don't equalize
├─ First barrel empties last (stagnant risk)
└─ Lower barrels have less pressure
```

**Installation:**
1. Position barrels near each other (same height)
2. Cut overflow hole in barrel 1 near top
3. Attach hose to overflow, direct into barrel 2 inlet
4. Repeat for subsequent barrels
5. Final barrel has overflow to drain/garden

---

### Parallel Connection (Equalized Pressure)

```
      Downpipe
         ↓
     Splitter
     ↙      ↘
Barrel 1  Barrel 2
     ↓        ↓
 ═══════════════ ← Connected near bottom
         ↓
       Tap

Advantages:
├─ All barrels at same level (equalized)
├─ Better pressure at tap
├─ Use water from any barrel
└─ All barrels drain together

Disadvantages:
├─ More complex plumbing
├─ Needs careful leveling
└─ One leak drains all
```

**Installation:**
1. Position barrels at exactly same height (use level)
2. Install connectors near bottom of each barrel
3. Connect with pipe/hose between barrels
4. Install single tap on one barrel (draws from all)
5. Each barrel needs overflow
6. Downpipe splits to multiple inlets (or fills one, overflows to next)

### Pumps (For Household Use)

**If using tank water for toilet/laundry/garden hose:**

**Options:**

```
1. Gravity (free!)
   ├─ Tank higher than use point
   ├─ Every 1m height = ~10kPa pressure
   ├─ Need ~250kPa for household use
   ├─ Means tank 25m high (impractical)
   └─ OK for slow garden trickle

2. Electric pump ($300-1,500)
   ├─ Mains powered
   ├─ Automatic (pressure switch)
   ├─ Good pressure (300-500kPa)
   ├─ Reliable
   └─ Needs power

3. Solar pump ($500-2,000)
   ├─ Solar panel + pump
   ├─ Off-grid
   ├─ Slower flow
   ├─ Initial cost higher
   └─ No running costs

4. Manual pump ($50-200)
   ├─ Hand-operated
   ├─ No power needed
   ├─ Slow
   ├─ Good for emergency/backup
   └─ Fills buckets, watering cans
```

**Basic electric pump setup:**

```
Tank → Filter → Pump → Pressure tank → House pipes
         ↓
    (optional but recommended)

Components:
├─ Pump ($300-800 for household)
├─ Pressure tank ($100-300)
├─ Non-return valve ($20-50)
├─ Filter ($50-150)
├─ Pressure switch (often included with pump)
└─ Plumbing fittings
```

## Water Quality

### Tank Water Safety

**For drinking (requires care):**

```
Essential:
├─ Clean roof (no asbestos, old paint)
├─ First-flush diverter
├─ Sealed tank (light-proof, mosquito-proof)
├─ Regular maintenance
├─ Filter before drinking
└─ Boil or treat if unsure

Australian Standard AS/NZS 4020:
└─ Tanks should meet this for drinking water
```

**For garden/toilet/laundry (easier):**

```
Requirements:
├─ Keep debris out
├─ Prevent mosquito breeding
├─ Annual cleanout
└─ That's it
```

---

### Maintenance Schedule

**Monthly:**
```
├─ Check for mosquito larvae (add mesh if found)
├─ Clear gutters of leaves
├─ Check overflow running freely
└─ Inspect for leaks
```

**Every 3-6 months:**
```
├─ Empty first-flush diverter
├─ Clean leaf guard
├─ Check tap washers
└─ Inspect pipes for cracks
```

**Annually:**
```
├─ Clean tank interior (empty, brush, rinse)
├─ Check all seals
├─ Replace filters
├─ Inspect roof/gutters
└─ Check stand stability
```

## Makeshift/Emergency Collection

### Tarp Catchment

**Quick setup for emergency water:**

```
Materials:
├─ Tarp (clean, food-safe if possible)
├─ Rope/cord
├─ Container
└─ Pole or trees

Setup:
1. Tie corners of tarp to trees/poles (slight slope)
2. Create low point in center or one corner
3. Place collection bucket under low point
4. Weight tarp edges (rocks) if needed
5. Wait for rain

Effectiveness:
├─ 3×4m tarp (12m²) in 10mm rain = ~100L
├─ Quick to deploy
├─ Portable
└─ Emergency situations
```

---

### Condensation Collection

**For minimal water in dry conditions:**

```
Vegetation bag:
1. Enclose living branch in clear plastic bag
2. Seal tightly around branch
3. Lowest point of bag should hang down
4. Condensation collects in corner
5. Can collect 50-500ml per day per bag
6. Slow but passive

Ground still (solar still):
1. Dig hole 60cm deep, 90cm wide
2. Place container in center
3. Cover hole with clear plastic
4. Weight center over container (small rock)
5. Seal edges (soil)
6. Condensation drips into container
7. Very slow (maybe 500ml per day in good conditions)
8. Energy-intensive to dig
9. Last resort
```

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Typical Sydney household (4 people):

**Water use:**
```
Total: ~200,000L per year
├─ Toilet: 60,000L (30%)
├─ Washing: 40,000L (20%)
├─ Shower: 50,000L (25%)
├─ Kitchen: 20,000L (10%)
├─ Garden: 20,000L (10%)
└─ Other: 10,000L (5%)
```

**Rain tank offset (5,000L tank):**
```
Can collect: ~80,000L per year (100m² roof, 1,200mm rain, 80% efficiency)
└─ More than house needs! (But tank only 5,000L)

Realistic offset:
├─ Garden: 20,000L (100% from tank)
├─ Toilet: 20,000L (partial)
├─ Washing: 10,000L (partial)
└─ Total: ~50,000L per year offset

Savings:
├─ Water: 50,000L @ $2.50/1000L = $125/year
├─ Sewage: 50,000L @ $1.80/1000L = $90/year
└─ Total: ~$215/year

Payback:
├─ 5,000L tank system: ~$1,500 installed
├─ Payback: 7 years
├─ Plus: drought security, garden health, fire reserve
└─ Long-term value excellent
```

## System Sizing

**How big should your tank be?**

### Method 1: Average rainfall approach

```
Formula:
Annual use (L) = Roof area (m²) × Rainfall (mm) × 0.8

Example (Melbourne):
├─ 100m² roof × 650mm rain × 0.8 = 52,000L per year
├─ But rainfall uneven (winter wet, summer dry)
├─ Tank needs to store water from wet for use in dry
└─ Generally: 2-3 months storage optimal

Melbourne example:
├─ Use 20,000L per year for garden
├─ 20,000L ÷ 12 months = 1,667L per month
├─ 3 months storage = 5,000L tank
└─ Match! 5,000L tank appropriate
```

---

### Method 2: Budget approach

**Start small, expand:**

```
Stage 1: Single rain barrel (200L)
├─ Cost: $50-150 DIY
├─ Learn system
├─ Water garden near downpipe
└─ Immediate benefit

Stage 2: Multiple barrels linked (600-1,000L)
├─ Cost: +$100-300
├─ More storage
├─ Cover most garden needs
└─ Still budget-friendly

Stage 3: Proper tank (2,000-5,000L)
├─ Cost: $600-1,500 installed
├─ Significant capacity
├─ Consider pump for household use
└─ Long-term investment

Stage 4: Large system (10,000L+)
├─ Cost: $2,500+
├─ Near self-sufficiency
├─ Whole-house supply potential
└─ Excellent bushfire reserve (in appropriate location)
```

## Troubleshooting

**Tank not filling:**
- Blocked gutter/screen
- First-flush diverter stuck
- Overflow stuck open
- Downpipe disconnected
- Not enough rain (check gauge)

**Mosquitoes in tank:**
- Add/fix screens on all openings
- Ensure tank sealed
- Overflow needs mesh
- Consider mosquito-eating fish (goldfish) in very large tanks

**Low water pressure:**
- Tank too low (elevate or add pump)
- Clogged filter
- Partially closed tap
- Leak in line (losing pressure)

**Water smells/tastes bad:**
- Tank needs cleaning
- Dead animal in gutter/tank
- Algae growth (keep light out)
- Stagnant (use regularly, overflow occasionally)

**Tank overflowing excessively:**
- Gutters clear (good)
- Tank too small for roof area (consider adding second tank)
- Overflow directed appropriately (prevent erosion)

**Key Principle:** Water is life. Every litre collected is a litre you don't pay for, a litre less strain on infrastructure, a litre you'll have in drought.

**Start simple:** One barrel this weekend. Expand from there.

**Remember:** "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now." Same with water collection. Start today.
