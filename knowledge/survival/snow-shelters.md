# Snow Shelters: Quinzhee & Snow Cave

**Category**: Shelter & Building
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Time Required**: 2-6 hours
**Materials**: Snow, shovel, probe stick
**Season**: Winter (sufficient snowpack)

## Overview

Snow shelters can save your life in winter emergencies. Snow is an excellent insulator - interior temps can be 30-50°F warmer than outside. Two main types: quinzhee (built from piled snow) and snow cave (dug into existing drift/slope).

## Snow as Insulation

**Why Snow Works**:
- Traps air (dead air space = insulation)
- Wind barrier
- Reflects body heat
- R-value increases with density (to a point)

**Temperature Reality**:
- Outside: -20°F
- Inside snow shelter: 20-35°F
- With body heat + candle: Can reach 40°F
- **Still cold, but survivable**

**Requirements**:
- Proper insulation under body (critical)
- Dry clothing
- Adequate ventilation

## Quinzhee (Pile & Hollow)

**Pronunciation**: KWIN-zee

**Advantages**:
- Works in moderate snow (2+ feet)
- Doesn't need slope/drift
- Easier than snow cave
- Safer (less avalanche risk)
- Can build on flat ground

**Disadvantages**:
- More labor intensive
- Takes longer
- Need to wait for snow to sinter (harden)

### Construction Steps

#### 1. Site Selection

**Good Sites**:
- Flat, open area
- Away from avalanche zones
- Away from hazards (dead trees, cliffs)
- Protected from prevailing wind if possible
- Well above water sources (cold air sinks)

**Avoid**:
- Cornices overhead
- Avalanche paths
- Under heavy snow-loaded trees
- Stream banks

#### 2. Pile Snow

**Process**:
1. **Mark your floor area** (6-8 feet diameter for 2 people)
2. **Pile gear in center** (backpacks, branches):
   - Creates hollow core
   - Less snow to move later
   - Maintains interior space
3. **Shovel snow onto pile**:
   - Work in circle around pile
   - Build to 6-8 feet high (standing height or more)
   - Dome shape (no flat spots for snow load)
   - Larger base than you need (walls will be thick)

**Amount Needed**:
- 1 person: 6-7 feet diameter, 6 feet high
- 2 people: 7-9 feet diameter, 6-7 feet high
- More people: Scale accordingly

**Time**: 1-2 hours of shoveling

#### 3. Sintering (Critical Wait)

**What is Sintering?**
- Snow crystals bond together
- Creates structural strength
- Metamorphism from disturbed to settled snow

**Wait Time**:
- **Minimum 1-2 hours** (longer better)
- Overnight ideal if time permits
- Cold temperatures: Longer wait
- Warm (near freezing): Faster sintering

**During Wait**:
- Rest (you'll be tired)
- Gather insulation materials
- Cut probe sticks
- Prepare entrance area

**Skip at your peril**: Walls may collapse during hollowing

#### 4. Probe Sticks (Wall Thickness Guides)

**Purpose**: Ensure uniform wall thickness

**Making Probes**:
1. Cut sticks to desired wall thickness (12-18 inches)
2. Need 20-30 sticks
3. All same length

**Placement**:
1. Push sticks into mound from outside
2. Perpendicular to surface
3. Push until 12-18 inches remains outside
4. Space evenly (every 12-18 inches) all over dome
5. Push to stop point (remaining portion = your wall thickness)

**Why Important**:
- Prevents thin spots (collapse risk)
- Prevents thick spots (wasted effort, less room)
- Visual guide when hollowing

#### 5. Excavation

**Entrance Location**:
- **Downwind side** (wind protection)
- Lower than sleeping platform (cold air sinks out)
- Small (minimize heat loss)

**Digging Process**:

1. **Start entrance**:
   - Cut small opening (3x2 feet)
   - Angle downward
   - Create entrance tunnel 3-4 feet long

2. **Hollow out interior**:
   - Start from entrance
   - Work back into mound
   - Remove center core (gear pile)
   - Dig until you see probe stick ends
   - **STOP when probe visible** (wall is thick enough)
   - Work systematically (don't undermine yourself)

3. **Shape interior**:
   - **Dome ceiling** (structural strength, no drips)
   - Smooth surfaces (no drip points)
   - Raised sleeping platform (above entrance)
   - Cold well (depression at entrance - cold air settles)

**Safety**:
- Two people: One inside, one outside
- Frequent communication
- Watch for structural issues
- Exit immediately if walls creak/settle

**Time**: 1-2 hours

#### 6. Ventilation (CRITICAL)

**Why Essential**:
- Carbon dioxide buildup (suffocation risk)
- Carbon monoxide if using stove/candle
- Condensation reduction

**Vent Holes**:
1. **Top vent** (fist-sized hole at apex)
   - Poke from inside out
   - Use ski pole, stick, or fist
   - Keep clear (check periodically)

2. **Entrance** (acts as vent)
   - Don't seal completely
   - Gap above door block
   - Air circulation path

**Signs of Poor Ventilation**:
- Headache
- Drowsiness
- Candle flame shrinks/flickers
- Stuffiness

**If Detected**: Make vent holes larger immediately

#### 7. Interior Finishing

**Sleeping Platform**:
- Raised 12-18 inches above entrance
- Level surface
- Smooth edges
- Wide enough to lie comfortably

**Cold Well**:
- Depression at entrance
- 6-12 inches deeper than platform
- Cold air sinks here (away from you)

**Storage Shelves** (optional):
- Carved into walls
- Above sleeping level
- For gear, boots, etc.

**Door Block**:
- Pack or snow block
- Fills entrance (not sealed)
- Reduces wind/heat loss
- Must allow air gap

**Smooth Walls**:
- Rub ceiling with gloved hand
- Creates slight glaze
- Reduces dripping
- Strengthens surface

### Living in Quinzhee

**Insulation Under Body**:
- **CRITICAL** - more important than above
- Sleeping pad (closed-cell foam best)
- Branches/boughs
- Pack
- Anything to break contact with snow

**Temperature Management**:
- Body heat warms interior
- Small candle adds warmth (ventilation!)
- Don't overheat (sweating = dangerous)
- Interior should stay below freezing (walls stay solid)

**Moisture Control**:
- Brush frost from ceiling daily
- Vent condensation
- Keep wet items outside or in entrance
- Don't dry clothes inside (adds moisture)

**Maintenance**:
- Check vent holes (keep clear)
- Repair any cracks/holes
- Remove frost buildup
- Monitor wall thickness

## Snow Cave (Dug into Drift)

**Requirements**:
- Deep snow drift (6+ feet)
- Stable slope
- Or deep snowpack on hillside

**Advantages**:
- Less labor than quinzhee
- Faster construction
- Uses existing snow structure

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires specific terrain
- Avalanche risk (must assess carefully)
- Harder to gauge wall thickness

### Construction Steps

#### 1. Site Selection (Critical)

**Ideal**:
- Lee side of ridge (snow accumulation)
- Firm, deep drift
- Stable slope (not avalanche terrain)
- Wind-deposited snow (denser)

**Avoid**:
- Avalanche paths
- Cornices overhead
- Unstable slopes
- Wet snow (collapse risk)

**Probe First**:
- Check depth (need 6+ feet)
- Check density (firm but workable)
- Ensure uniform depth

#### 2. Entrance

**Dig in at base of drift**:
1. Entrance on downwind side
2. Start low (below final floor level)
3. Tunnel upward at angle
4. 3-4 feet long tunnel

**Purpose of Upward Angle**:
- Cold air drains out
- Warmer air trapped inside
- Creates cold well

#### 3. Excavation

**From tunnel, hollow out**:
1. Expand into main chamber
2. Work from bottom up
3. Create dome ceiling (strength + no drips)
4. Sleeping platform above entrance level

**Wall Thickness**:
- Minimum 12 inches (18+ better)
- Test with probe or fist
- Look for light coming through (too thin)
- Blue glow = getting thin

**Shape**:
- Dome or barrel vault
- No flat ceilings (weak, drip points)
- Smooth transitions
- Remove all loose snow

#### 4. Ventilation

**Same as quinzhee**:
- Fist-sized hole at top
- Air gap at entrance
- Monitor and maintain

### T-Slot Cave (Advanced)

**Design**:
```
     [Vent]
       |
   ┌───┴───┐
   │ Sleep │
   └───┬───┘
       │
   [Entrance]
```

**Features**:
- Entrance tunnel at right angle to chamber
- Better wind protection
- More complex but warmer

## Safety Considerations

### Structural Integrity

**Warnings**:
- Cracking sounds
- Walls settling
- Visible stress lines
- Sagging ceiling

**If Detected**:
- Exit immediately
- Rebuild or reinforce
- Don't risk collapse

### Avalanche Risk

**Never build in**:
- Active avalanche paths
- Below cornices
- Steep slopes (>30°)
- Recent avalanche debris

**Signs of Danger**:
- "Whumpfing" sounds (settling)
- Cracks radiating from footsteps
- Heavy recent snowfall
- Warm temps after cold (weak layer)

### Ventilation (Life/Death)

**CO₂ Poisoning Symptoms**:
- Headache (first sign)
- Dizziness
- Nausea
- Drowsiness
- Confusion

**Action**: Increase ventilation immediately, exit if severe

### Hypothermia Prevention

**Snow shelter ≠ warm**:
- Still below freezing inside
- Need proper:
  - Sleeping bag (rated for temps)
  - Insulation (sleeping pad)
  - Dry clothing
  - Calories (fuel body heat)

**Stay Dry**:
- Don't sweat during construction
- Layer clothing
- Remove layers as you heat up
- Wet = life-threatening in cold

## Emergency Quick Build

**If caught in storm, need shelter NOW:**

1. **Find drift/slope**
2. **Dig straight in** (3 feet)
3. **Hollow out small space** (just big enough)
4. **Vent hole at top**
5. **Block entrance with pack**
6. **Get off snow** (insulation under you)

**Time**: 30-60 minutes
**Survivability**: Adequate for short-term

## Tools & Equipment

**Essential**:
- Shovel (collapsible snow shovel)
- Probe (ski pole or stick)
- Insulation (sleeping pad)
- Sleeping bag (cold-rated)

**Helpful**:
- Snow saw (cut blocks)
- Tarp (door, ground cloth)
- Candle (light + minor heat)
- Matches/lighter
- Whistle (if buried)

**Improvised**:
- Snowshoe as shovel
- Ski as saw
- Branches as probe
- Pack lid as scoop

## Comparison: Quinzhee vs Snow Cave

| Factor | Quinzhee | Snow Cave |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Time** | 3-4 hours | 2-3 hours |
| **Terrain** | Flat OK | Need drift/slope |
| **Snow Depth** | 2+ feet | 6+ feet |
| **Skill** | Easier | Harder |
| **Safety** | Safer (less avalanche) | More risk |
| **Effort** | High (piling) | Medium (digging) |
| **Strength** | Very strong (sintered) | Good |

## Tips for Success

**Construction**:
- Work in shifts (don't exhaust yourself)
- Stay dry (critical)
- Eat and hydrate (building burns calories)
- Build early (daylight + time to dry)
- Bigger is better (more insulation, less claustrophobic)

**Overnight**:
- Mark entrance (can get buried)
- Vertical marker (ski pole with flag)
- Keep shovel inside (emergency exit)
- Check vents before sleeping
- Sleep in all your layers

**Group Shelters**:
- More body heat
- Shared labor
- BUT: More moisture, more breath, need better ventilation

## Common Mistakes

**Insufficient Wall Thickness**:
- Collapse risk
- Heat loss
- Use probe sticks

**Poor Ventilation**:
- CO₂ buildup
- Always maintain vent holes

**Wet Clothing**:
- Remove layers during work
- Stay dry at all costs

**No Insulation Under Body**:
- Ground contact = heat loss
- Will not sleep, will freeze

**Building Too Small**:
- Hard to work in
- Cramped
- Less insulation
- Go bigger

**Skipping Sintering Wait**:
- Quinzhee collapse during excavation
- Be patient

## Practice Recommendations

**Learn Before You Need**:
1. Practice in controlled setting
2. Backyard or park
3. With expert instruction first
4. Daylight, good weather
5. Have backup shelter

**Progression**:
1. Small quinzhee (learn technique)
2. Full-size quinzhee
3. Overnight in quinzhee (safe conditions)
4. Snow cave (with experienced person)
5. Emergency quick builds

**Don't learn during emergency**
