# Essential Knots for Survival

**Category**: Tools & Skills
**Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate
**Time Required**: Practice until automatic
**Materials**: Rope, cordage, or improvised line
**Season**: All seasons

## Overview

Knot-tying is a fundamental survival skill. The right knot can secure shelter, haul gear, create tools, and save lives. Master these essential knots and understand when to use each.

## Knot Terminology

**Standing End**: The long, inactive end of rope
**Working End**: The end you're tying with
**Bight**: A U-shaped bend in rope (not crossed)
**Loop**: Rope crossed over itself forming a circle
**Turn**: One wrap around an object

## The Essential Eight (Master These First)

### 1. Bowline - "King of Knots"

**Purpose**: Creates fixed loop that won't slip or bind

**Uses**:
- Rescue (loop around person)
- Securing to tree/post
- End of climbing rope
- Makeshift harness

**How to Tie** ("Rabbit Hole" Method):
1. Make small loop (rabbit hole) in standing end
2. Pass working end up through loop (rabbit out of hole)
3. Around behind standing end (around tree)
4. Back down through original loop (back in hole)
5. Tighten by pulling standing end and loop

**Mnemonic**: "Rabbit comes out of hole, around the tree, back in the hole"

**Pros**:
- Easy to untie after loading
- Won't slip
- Won't bind tight
- Strong

**Cons**:
- Can loosen if not under load
- Not ideal for slippery rope

**Test**: Should be able to tie one-handed, eyes closed

### 2. Square Knot (Reef Knot)

**Purpose**: Join two ropes of equal diameter

**Uses**:
- Tying bandages
- Bundling items
- Temporary rope joining (NOT for critical loads)

**How to Tie**:
1. Right over left and under
2. Left over right and under
3. "Right over left, left over right"

**Visual Check**: Ends should exit parallel to their standing lines

**CRITICAL**:
- **NOT for climbing or life-safety**
- Can slip under certain loads
- Only for equal-diameter ropes
- Can capsize (invert and fail)

**Pros**:
- Quick to tie
- Lays flat
- Easy to untie

**Cons**:
- Can fail under load
- Slips with different diameter ropes

## Knot Selection Guide

**Situation** → **Best Knot**

- Fixed loop in end of rope → Bowline or Figure-8 Loop
- Join two equal ropes → Square Knot (low-load) or Double Fisherman's
- Join different diameter ropes → Sheet Bend
- Attach to post/tree → Two Half Hitches or Clove Hitch
- Adjustable guy line → Taut-Line Hitch
- Maximum tension needed → Trucker's Hitch
- Drag a log → Timber Hitch
- Climb or rescue → Figure-8 Loop or Bowline
- Quick release → Slip knot variations
- Grip main rope → Prusik Hitch

## Practice Progression

### Stage 1: Basic Competency
- Tie each essential knot correctly
- Understand purpose
- Slow, checking each step

### Stage 2: Speed
- Muscle memory development
- Tie without thinking
- Time yourself

### Stage 3: Difficult Conditions
- One-handed (bowline critical)
- In the dark
- With gloves
- Wet rope
- While fatigued

### Stage 4: Application
- Real-world scenarios
- Choose right knot for situation
- Combine knots (e.g., trucker's hitch uses half hitches)

## Common Mistakes

**Not Dressing the Knot**:
- "Dressing" = arranging strands neatly
- Undressed knots weaker and more likely to fail
- Always tighten and neaten

**Wrong Knot for Application**:
- Square knot for climbing (NEVER)
- Granny knot instead of square (won't hold)
- Using complex knot when simple works better

**Not Testing**:
- Always test knot before trusting with load
- Pull on both ends
- Verify it tightens correctly

**Leaving Too Little Tail**:
- Minimum 6" tail on working end
- Prevents knot from "working loose"
- Safety factor

## Rope Care

**Inspection**:
- Check for fraying
- Sun damage (UV degrades nylon)
- Chemical exposure
- Wear at high-stress points

**Storage**:
- Coil properly (prevents kinks)
- Dry before storing
- Out of direct sun
- Away from chemicals/solvents

**Field Repairs**:
- Whip frayed ends (wrap tightly with small cord)
- Cut out damaged sections
- Fuse synthetic rope ends (carefully melt)

## Improvised Cordage

**Natural Materials**:
- Inner bark (basswood, cedar, willow)
- Plant fibers (yucca, cattail leaves, nettle)
- Sinew (animal tendons)
- Roots (spruce, willow)
- Vines (grape, wisteria)

**Improvised**:
- Paracord inner strands (7 strands in 550 cord)
- Clothing strips (fabric)
- Plastic bags (twisted or braided)
- Wire (electrical, baling)

## Knot Strength

**General Rules**:
- Any knot weakens rope (15-50% strength loss)
- Bends (sharp curves) create stress points
- More wraps generally = stronger but bulkier
- Wet rope is weaker than dry

**Relative Strength** (% of rope strength):
- Figure-8 Loop: ~75-80%
- Bowline: ~60-75%
- Square Knot: ~45%
- Sheet Bend: ~55%

## Safety Notes

**For Life-Safety**:
- Use figure-8 or bowline (not square knot)
- Inspect knots regularly
- Understand load ratings of rope
- When in doubt, use stronger/more secure knot

**Redundancy**:
- Backup critical knots
- Multiple anchors
- Safety lines
