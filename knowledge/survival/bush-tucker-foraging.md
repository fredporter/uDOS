## 8. Harvesting Ethics & Sustainability

```
Aboriginal Sustainable Practices:
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Take only what you need             │
│ ✓ Leave some for replanting           │
│ ✓ Rotate harvest areas                │
│ ✓ Don't damage plant (if possible)    │
│ ✓ Thank the land (cultural respect)   │
│ ✓ Know the seasons                    │
│ ✓ Share knowledge responsibly         │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

Emergency vs Long-term:
Emergency (survival):
  Take what you need to live

Long-term (sustainable living):
  Follow traditional practices
  Ensure future harvests
  Respect Aboriginal knowledge
```
