# Rainwater Harvesting Systems

**Category**: Water Systems
**Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate
**Time Required**: Hours to days (system size)
**Materials**: Gutters, tanks, filtration
**Season**: Year-round (varies by rainfall)

## Overview

Rainwater harvesting captures free, relatively clean water from your roof. Reduces dependence on wells or municipal water. Can provide drinking water with proper treatment, or non-potable water for irrigation, livestock, washing.

## System Components

### 1. Catchment Surface (Roof)

**Best Roof Materials**:
- Metal (steel, aluminum, copper) - cleanest
- Tile (ceramic, concrete) - good
- Slate - good
- Composition shingles - acceptable (some chemical leaching)

**Avoid**:
- Asbestos shingles (toxic)
- Wood shingles (rot, mold)
- Treated wood shakes (chemicals)
- Lead flashing

**Roof Area Calculation**:
- Measure footprint (not actual roof area)
- Example: 30' × 40' house = 1,200 sq ft catchment

### 2. Gutters & Downspouts

**Materials**:
- Aluminum (most common, lightweight)
- Vinyl (cheap, can crack in cold)
- Copper (expensive, long-lasting)
- Galvanized steel (durable, can rust)

**Sizing**:
- 5" gutters standard residential
- 6" gutters for large roofs or high rainfall
- Downspouts: 2×3" or 3×4"
- One downspout per 600-800 sq ft roof

**Installation**:
- Slope toward downspouts (1/4" per 10')
- Secure mounting every 60-90cm
- Clean regularly (leaf guards help)

### 3. First Flush Diverter

**Purpose**: Diverts first dirty water (bird droppings, dust, debris)

**Types**:

**Simple Diverter**:
- PVC pipe with cap
- Fills first, then overflow goes to tank
- Manual drain after rain
- Cheap, effective

**Automatic Diverter**:
- Floating ball seals after diverter fills
- Self-draining with small hole
- More expensive
- Less maintenance

**Sizing**:
- 10-25 gallons per 1,000 sq ft roof
- More for dirtier roofs
- First 0.01" of rain

**Why Critical**:
- Roof is dirty (especially after dry period)
- First flush contains most contamination
- Dramatically improves water quality

### 4. Filtration

**Pre-Tank Filtration**:

**Mesh Screen** (basic):
- 1/16" mesh minimum
- Keeps leaves, large debris out
- At gutter, downspout, or tank inlet

**Inline Filter**:
- 5-50 micron
- Removes finer particles
- Cartridge replacement needed

**Post-Tank Filtration** (for potable use):

**Sediment Filter**:
- 5-20 micron
- Removes particles
- First stage

**Carbon Filter**:
- Removes chlorine, odors, chemicals
- Improves taste
- Second stage

**UV or Final Treatment**:
- Kills bacteria, viruses
- Or use purification methods (see related guides)

### 5. Storage Tanks

**Materials**:

**Polyethylene (Plastic)**:
- Most common
- Food-grade (BPA-free)
- UV-resistant if outdoor
- Lightweight
- 50-10,000+ gallon sizes

**Fiberglass**:
- Durable
- No algae growth
- More expensive
- Long-lasting

**Concrete/Cistern**:
- Underground or above
- Huge capacity possible
- Expensive installation
- Very durable
- Needs sealing

**Steel**:
- Galvanized or stainless
- Food-grade lining needed
- Heavy
- Durable

**Avoid**:
- Used chemical containers
- Non-food-grade plastic
- Unlined metal (rust/contamination)

**Sizing**:
- See calculation section below
- Bigger = better (within budget)
- Multiple smaller tanks OK

**Features**:
- **Opaque** (prevents algae)
- **Sealed lid** (mosquitoes, debris)
- **Overflow** outlet
- **Drain** at bottom
- **Access port** (cleaning)
- **Level indicator**

### 6. Distribution

**Gravity-Fed** (Simplest):
- Tank elevated above use point
- 1 PSI per 70cm (0.7m) elevation
- Example: Tank 23' above tap = ~10 PSI
- No pump needed
- Limited pressure

**Pump System**:
- Submersible or inline pump
- Pressure tank (maintains pressure)
- Automatic on/off
- More pressure, more flexible
- Requires power

## Calculating Collection Potential

**Formula**: Roof Area (sq ft) × Rainfall (inches) × 0.623 = Gallons

**Example**:
- 1,200 sq ft roof
- 1 inch of rain
- 1,200 × 1 × 0.623 = 748 gallons

**Annual Potential**:
- Find average annual rainfall (inches)
- Multiply by formula
- Example: 40" annual rainfall × 748 = 29,920 gallons/year

**Account for Losses**:
- Evaporation: ~5%
- Spillage/overflow: ~5%
- First flush: ~5%
- Use 85% of calculated (0.85 multiplier)
- Realistic: 29,920 × 0.85 = 25,432 gallons/year

## Sizing Storage

### Method 1: Simple

**Basic Rule**: 1-2 weeks of water use

**Example**:
- Family of 4
- 50 gallons/person/day (typical US use)
- 200 gallons/day total
- 2 weeks = 200 × 14 = 2,800 gallons minimum

### Method 2: Dry Season Storage

**Account for seasonal variation**:
1. Find longest dry period (days without rain)
2. Multiply by daily use
3. Add safety margin (20%)

**Example**:
- Longest dry spell: 60 days (summer)
- Use: 200 gallons/day
- Need: 60 × 200 × 1.2 = 14,400 gallons

### Method 3: Optimize Cost/Benefit

**Diminishing Returns**:
- Larger tanks = more expensive per gallon
- Balance catchment vs storage
- Model monthly rainfall vs usage

**Use spreadsheet**:
- Monthly rainfall averages
- Monthly usage
- Tank size scenarios
- Find sweet spot

**Often**: 1,000-5,000 gallons for residential

## Installation Steps

### Basic Gravity System

1. **Install Gutters**:
   - Proper slope (1/4" per 10 ft to downspout)
   - Secure mounting
   - Sealed joints

2. **Add Gutter Guards** (optional but recommended):
   - Mesh screens
   - Keeps leaves out
   - Reduces maintenance

3. **Install First Flush Diverter**:
   - At downspout before tank
   - Size appropriately
   - Include drain valve

4. **Prepare Tank Location**:
   - Level, stable base
   - Gravel pad or concrete
   - Elevated if gravity-fed
   - Access for cleaning
   - Away from trees (falling debris, roots)

5. **Position Tank**:
   - Close to downspout (short pipe run)
   - Close to use point if possible
   - Overflow directed away from foundation

6. **Connect Inlet**:
   - From downspout/diverter to tank
   - Screen at tank inlet
   - Sealed penetration

7. **Install Overflow**:
   - Near top of tank
   - Larger diameter than inlet
   - Direct to drainage area or additional tanks
   - Screen to prevent entry

8. **Add Spigot/Outlet**:
   - 6-12" above bottom (sediment settles)
   - Ball valve (easy on/off)
   - Garden hose thread

9. **Cover/Seal**:
   - Tight lid (mosquitoes!)
   - Vented (prevents vacuum)
   - Opaque (algae prevention)

### Pump System Addition

**Components**:
- Pump (sized for flow and pressure needed)
- Pressure tank (20-80 gallons typical)
- Pressure switch (automatic on/off)
- Check valve (prevents backflow)
- Pressure gauge
- Shutoff valves

**Installation**:
1. Pump intake from tank (screen/filter)
2. Check valve after pump
3. Pressure tank
4. Pressure switch
5. Distribution plumbing

**Professional help recommended** for pumped systems

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

**Weekly/After Rain**:
- Check first flush diverter (drain if manual)
- Visual inspection of gutters
- Check overflow operation

**Monthly**:
- Clean gutter screens/guards
- Check tank level
- Inspect for leaks
- Clean pre-filters

**Quarterly**:
- Deep clean gutters

- Replace filters (as needed)
- Test pump (if applicable)

**Yearly**:
- Tank cleaning (if accessible)
- Inspect roof condition
- Check/repair gutters
- System evaluation

### Tank Cleaning

**When**:
- Sediment buildup
- Water quality decline
- Odor/taste issues
- Every 2-5 years preventatively

**Process**:
1. Drain tank completely
2. Remove sediment (shop vac or manual)
3. Scrub interior with brush
4. Rinse thoroughly
5. Sanitize if needed (dilute bleach solution)
6. Rinse again
7. Refill

**Safety**:
- Confined space (ventilation!)
- Never enter tank alone
- Proper safety equipment

## Water Quality

### Typical Quality

**Rainwater is**:
- Naturally soft (low minerals)
- Slightly acidic (pH 5-6)
- Generally clean (after first flush)

**Potential Contaminants**:
- Bird droppings (bacteria)
- Roof materials (metals, chemicals)
- Airborne pollutants (especially near industry)
- Algae (if tank allows light)
- Mosquito larvae (if not sealed)

### Making Potable

**For Drinking Water**:

1. **First Flush** (removes most contamination)

2. **Filtration**:
   - Sediment filter (5 micron)
   - Carbon filter (taste, chemicals)
   - Fine filter (1 micron or less)

3. **Disinfection** (Choose one):
   - UV sterilizer (kills bacteria, viruses)
   - Chlorination (add bleach, wait, carbon filter removes)
   - Boiling (before use)
   - Commercial purification

4. **Testing**:
   - Annual water testing (bacteria, pH, minerals)
   - After system changes
   - If taste/odor changes

### Non-Potable Uses

**Without full treatment**:
- Garden irrigation (generally safe)
- Toilet flushing
- Car washing
- Outdoor cleaning
- Livestock (depends on animal, test first)

**Separate plumbing** for potable vs non-potable

- Draw down during dry
- Size for longest dry spell

## Troubleshooting

**Low Water Quality**:
- Improve first flush
- Add/upgrade filtration
- Clean tank
- Check roof condition

**Algae Growth**:
- Ensure tank is opaque
- Check for light leaks
- Cover completely
- Consider algaecide (food-safe)

**Mosquitoes**:
- Seal all openings
- Screen vents
- Tight lid
- Check overflow screen

**Insufficient Water**:
- Increase tank size
- Add more catchment area
- Reduce usage
- Supplement with other source

**Tank Overflow Issues**:
- Overflow pipe too small (increase size)
- Not draining away (improve drainage)
- Tank too small (add capacity)

## Winter Considerations

**Freezing Climates**:

**Tanks**:
- Insulate or move indoors
- Underground tanks (below frost line)
- Drain if not frost-proof
- Heat tape (with power)

**Gutters**:
- Can ice up (normal)
- Heat cables (expensive, energy)
- Usually just wait for thaw

**Distribution**:
- Bury lines below frost line
- Heat trace pipes
- Drain exposed lines

**Snow Collection**:
- Roof snow melts → runoff
- Works, but less collection in winter
- Spring snowmelt = good collection

## Integration with Other Systems

**Greywater Reuse**:
- Rainwater for primary use
- Greywater for irrigation
- Reduces both draw

**Well Backup**:
- Rainwater first
- Well when tanks low
- Automatic switching

**Grid Water Supplement**:
- Rainwater for non-potable
- Grid for drinking (or vice versa)
- Emergency backup both directions

## Advanced: Multi-Tank Systems

**Series Connection**:
- Tanks fill in sequence
- First fills, overflows to second
- Easy to add capacity

**Parallel Connection**:
- Tanks fill simultaneously
- All at same level
- Requires proper plumbing

**Combination**:
- Multiple series chains in parallel
- Maximize site usage
- Flexible expansion
