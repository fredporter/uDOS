# Map & Compass Navigation

**Category**: Communication & Navigation
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Time Required**: Skill takes practice
**Materials**: Map, compass, optional GPS
**Season**: All seasons

## Overview

GPS devices fail. Batteries die. Knowing map and compass navigation is essential for wilderness travel, route planning, and finding your way home when technology fails.

## Equipment

### The Compass

**Essential Features**:
- **Baseplate compass** (orienteering style) recommended
- **Rotating bezel** with 360° markings
- **Direction of travel arrow** on baseplate
- **Orienting arrow** in compass housing
- **Magnetic needle** (red end points North)
- **Ruler** on baseplate edge
- **Declination adjustment** (advanced)

**Quality Brands**: Suunto, Silva, Brunton

**NOT Recommended**:
- Button compasses (keychains)
- Phone compass apps (backup only)
- Lensatic compass (for beginners - different technique)

### The Map

**Topographic Map** (Topo):
- Shows terrain elevation
- Contour lines represent elevation
- Standard scale: 1:24,000 (US) or 1:50,000 (Canada)
- Shows trails, roads, water, structures

**Where to Get**:
- USGS (US Geological Survey) - free digital
- National Geographic Trails Illustrated
- Caltopo.com (custom printable)
- Local outdoor stores

**Prepare Map**:
- Waterproof (map case or laminate)
- Highlight your route
- Mark key waypoints
- Note declination

## Understanding the Map

### Contour Lines (Elevation)

**Basic Rules**:
- Each line = specific elevation
- **Contour interval** = height between lines (usually 40-80 feet)
- Lines close together = steep
- Lines far apart = gentle slope
- Lines very close = cliff

**Index Contours**:
- Every 5th line is thicker
- Labeled with elevation
- Makes counting easier

**Reading Terrain**:
- **V-shapes pointing uphill** = valley/drainage
- **V-shapes pointing downhill** = ridge
- **Concentric circles** = hilltop or depression
- **Closed loops with ticks** = depression (ticks point down)

### Map Symbols

**Water**:
- Blue lines = streams, rivers
- Blue areas = lakes, ponds
- Dotted blue = intermittent stream
- Double line = wide river

**Trails**:
- Dashed black/red line = trail
- Solid line = road
- Different dash patterns = different trail types

**Vegetation**:
- Green = forested
- White = open/clearings
- Pattern variations = different vegetation types

**Human Features**:
- Black squares = buildings
- Black lines = roads, trails, boundaries
- Red lines = major roads

### Map Scale

**1:24,000** (common US topo):
- 1 inch on map = 24,000 inches on ground (2,000 feet)
- 2.64 inches = 1 mile
- Good detail level for hiking

**1:50,000**:
- Less detail, larger area coverage

**Use Ruler on Compass Baseplate**:
- Usually has multiple scales marked
- Measure distance on map
- Convert using scale

## Compass Basics

### Parts of Baseplate Compass

1. **Baseplate** - clear plastic base
2. **Direction of travel arrow** - points where you're going
3. **Compass housing** - rotating dial
4. **Orienting arrow** - outline/box inside housing
5. **Magnetic needle** - red points to Magnetic North
6. **Orienting lines** - parallel lines in housing
7. **Degree markings** - 0-360° on bezel

### Cardinal Directions

- **North**: 0° or 360°
- **East**: 90°
- **South**: 180°
- **West**: 270°

**Intercardinal**:
- NE: 45°
- SE: 135°
- SW: 225°
- NW: 315°

### Taking a Bearing

**Bearing** = direction expressed in degrees

**Field Bearing** (to visible landmark):

1. **Point direction of travel arrow at target**
2. **Rotate bezel until orienting arrow aligns with red needle** ("red in the shed")
3. **Read bearing at index line** (where bezel meets baseplate)
4. **You now have bearing to target**

**Following a Bearing**:
1. **Set bearing** on bezel (rotate to desired number)
2. **Hold compass flat at waist level**
3. **Turn your body** until red needle aligns with orienting arrow
4. **Look up** - direction of travel arrow points your direction
5. **Pick landmark** on that line (tree, rock)
6. **Walk to landmark**, repeat process

**Critical**: Don't turn bezel once bearing is set. Turn your body instead.

## Map and Compass Together

### Orienting the Map (Most Important Skill)

**Purpose**: Align map with actual terrain (map north = true north)

**Steps**:
1. **Lay map flat**
2. **Place compass on map** with edge along map's edge
3. **Rotate map and compass together** until magnetic needle aligns with north lines on map
4. **Map now oriented to landscape**

**Why It Matters**:
- Everything on map matches what you see
- "That mountain is east" - look east on map
- Intuitive navigation

### Finding Your Location (Triangulation)

**When**: You're lost but can see 2-3 landmarks you can identify on map

**Steps**:

1. **Identify landmark** (mountain, tower, lake)
2. **Find same landmark on map**
3. **Take bearing to landmark**:
   - Point compass at landmark
   - Rotate bezel for "red in shed"
   - Read bearing
4. **Reverse the bearing** (add or subtract 180°):
   - If < 180°: add 180
   - If > 180°: subtract 180
   - This is "back bearing" (from landmark to you)
5. **Plot on map**:
   - Place compass edge on landmark on map
   - Rotate entire compass (not bezel) until orienting lines align with north lines on map
   - Draw line along compass edge from landmark
   - You're somewhere on this line
6. **Repeat with second landmark**
7. **Where lines cross = your position**

**Three landmarks** = more accurate (lines form triangle, you're in middle)

### Navigating to Destination on Map

**You are here, want to go there**:

1. **Place compass on map**:
   - Edge connects current location to destination
   - Direction of travel arrow points toward destination

2. **Rotate bezel**:
   - Align orienting lines with north lines on map
   - Ignore needle (it's map work now)

3. **Read bearing** at index line:
   - This is your travel bearing

4. **Navigate**:
   - Hold compass flat
   - Turn body until red needle aligns with orienting arrow
   - Direction of travel arrow now points to destination
   - Pick landmark, walk to it, repeat

## Magnetic Declination (Critical)

### The Problem

- **True North**: Geographic North Pole (map north)
- **Magnetic North**: Where compass points (currently in Canada, moves slowly)
- **Difference** = Declination (varies by location: 0° to 20°)

**Why It Matters**:
- 1° error = ~100 feet off per mile
- 10° declination ignored = 1/2 mile off after 3 miles
- MUST correct for accurate navigation

### Find Your Declination

**Sources**:
- Declination diagram on topo map (bottom margin)
- NOAA website (ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag)
- App: Compass by Orux (shows local declination)

**Example**:
- "15° East" or "15° E"
- Means magnetic north is 15° east of true north

### Correcting for Declination

**Two Methods**:

**Method 1: Adjust Compass** (if compass has declination adjustment)
- Set once, forget it
- Follow manufacturer's instructions
- Changes mechanical offset

**Method 2: Manual Math** (if no adjustment feature)

**Map to Field** (bearing from map, going to walk it):
- Declination **East**: Subtract from map bearing
  - Map bearing 90°, 15° E declination = set compass to 75°
  - "East is least" (subtract)
- Declination **West**: Add to map bearing
  - Map bearing 90°, 15° W declination = set compass to 105°
  - "West is best" (add)

**Field to Map** (bearing from field, plotting on map):
- Opposite: East add, West subtract

**Mnemonic**: "From map to field: East is least, West is best"

## Advanced Techniques

### Aiming Off

**Problem**: Small target (trail junction) - exact bearing may miss it

**Solution**:
- Aim to one side intentionally
- When you hit trail, you know which way to turn
- Example: Aim 5° left of target. When hit trail, turn right.

### Handrail Navigation

**Use linear features as guides**:
- Rivers
- Roads
- Ridgelines
- Power lines

**Benefits**:
- Don't need constant bearing checks
- Faster travel
- Hard to get lost

### Catching Features

**Pick feature beyond destination**:
- If you go too far, you'll hit it
- Example: Destination is cabin before river. If you hit river, you went too far.
- Provides error detection

### Pacing (Distance Measurement)

**Count steps to measure distance**:

1. **Determine your pace count**:
   - Measure 100 feet (or 100 meters)
   - Walk normally, count every time RIGHT foot hits (or every other step)
   - Repeat 3 times, average
   - Result: "My pace count is X per 100 feet"

2. **In field**:
   - Measure map distance to target
   - Convert to paces needed
   - Count as you walk
   - Know when you should arrive

**Factors that change pace**:
- Uphill (longer)
- Downhill (shorter)
- Fatigue (longer)
- Terrain (rough = longer)
- Load (heavier = longer)

**Compensate**: Test pace in similar conditions

### Boxing (Avoiding Obstacles)

**Problem**: Obstacle (cliff, lake) blocks direct route

**Solution**:
1. Turn 90° from original bearing
2. Count paces around obstacle
3. Turn back to original bearing, pass obstacle
4. Turn 90° opposite direction
5. Walk same number of paces
6. Turn back to original bearing
7. Continue to destination

**Result**: Bypassed obstacle, stayed on course

## Navigation Without Compass

### Sun Navigation

**Northern Hemisphere**:
- Sun rises east, sets west
- Noon: sun due south (highest point)
- Morning: sun southeast
- Afternoon: sun southwest

**Shadow Stick Method**:
1. Put stick vertical in ground
2. Mark shadow tip (stone)
3. Wait 15-30 minutes
4. Mark new shadow tip
5. Line between marks runs east-west (first mark = west)
6. Perpendicular line = north-south

### Star Navigation

**North Star (Polaris)**:
- Only star that doesn't move
- Indicates true north
- Find using Big Dipper:
  - Locate Big Dipper (7 stars)
  - "Pointer stars" (front edge of cup)
  - Extend line from pointers 5x distance
  - Lands on Polaris (Little Dipper handle end)

**Southern Hemisphere**:
- Use Southern Cross
- No convenient "south star"

### Nature Signs (Least Reliable)

**Use only for general awareness, not precision**:
- Moss on north side: Sometimes, not always
- Tree growth: Unreliable
- Snow melt: North-facing slopes hold snow longer (Northern Hemisphere)

## Common Mistakes

**Not Adjusting for Declination**:
- Biggest error source
- Always correct

**Holding Compass Wrong**:
- Must be flat/level
- Away from metal (belt buckle, knife, phone)
- Waist level, not chest/head

**Turning Bezel After Setting Bearing**:
- Bezel stays put
- Turn body instead

**Not Orienting Map**:
- Trying to navigate from upside-down map
- Always orient first

**Trusting Single Landmark**:
- Use multiple confirmations
- Triangulation better than single bearing

**Poor Map Reading**:
- Confusing ridge for valley
- Wrong contour interpretation
- Always correlate map to terrain

## Practice Exercises

**Beginner**:
1. Orient map at known location
2. Take bearings to visible landmarks
3. Follow bearing to nearby object (100 feet)
4. Find yourself on map (known location)

**Intermediate**:
1. Plot course on map (multiple waypoints)
2. Calculate bearings for each leg
3. Navigate course
4. Triangulate position from 3 landmarks

**Advanced**:
1. Navigate at night (with headlamp)
2. Navigate in forest (no distant landmarks)
3. Navigation competition (time + accuracy)
4. Navigate with intentional declination error (then correct)

## Survival Priorities

**If Lost**:
1. **STOP** (Stop, Think, Observe, Plan)
2. **Don't panic**
3. **Get map oriented**
4. **Identify landmarks** you can see
5. **Triangulate position**
6. **Plan route** to known location or safety
7. **Follow plan** carefully
8. **Leave breadcrumbs** (figurative - mark your path)

**If Navigation Fails**:
- **Follow water downstream** (usually leads to civilization)
- **Stay on ridges** (easier travel, better views)
- **Handrail features** (roads, power lines)
- **Signal for help** if appropriate

## Modern Integration

**GPS as Backup**:
- Carry GPS/phone
- Download offline maps
- Extra batteries/power bank
- Don't rely exclusively

**Phone Apps** (useful):
- Gaia GPS
- AllTrails
- Caltopo
- OS Maps

**Always carry paper map + compass**: Electronics fail
