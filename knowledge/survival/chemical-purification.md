# Water Purification: Chemical Methods

**Category**: Water Systems
**Difficulty**: Beginner
**Time Required**: 30 minutes to 4 hours (depending on method)
**Materials**: Purification tablets or liquid chemical treatment
**Effectiveness**: 99.9% against most pathogens

## Overview

Chemical purification uses iodine, chlorine, or chlorine dioxide to kill waterborne pathogens. Lightweight, compact, and requires no fuel - ideal for emergency kits and backpacking.

## Chemical Options Comparison

| Chemical | Bacteria | Viruses | Giardia | Crypto | Taste | Wait Time |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Chlorine Dioxide | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Minimal | 30 min - 4 hrs |
| Iodine | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Limited | Strong | 30-60 min |
| Chlorine (Bleach) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Limited | Moderate | 30-60 min |
| Aquatabs (NaDCC) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Limited | Mild | 30 min |

## Chlorine Dioxide (Most Effective)

**Brand Names**: Aquamira, Katadyn Micropur MP1, Potable Aqua Chlorine Dioxide

**Advantages**:
- Kills Cryptosporidium (others don't)
- Minimal taste/odor
- Effective in wider pH range
- Works in cold water
- Long shelf life (4+ years sealed)

**Disadvantages**:
- Longer wait time (30 min to 4 hours for Crypto)
- Two-part system (mixing required)
- More expensive
- Mixing requires small wait before adding to water

### Aquamira Drops (Two-Part System)

**Dosage per Liter**:
- Part A (Chlorine Dioxide): 7 drops
- Part B (Activator): 7 drops
- Mix A+B in cap, wait 5 minutes (turns yellow)
- Add to water, wait 15-30 minutes

**For Heavy Contamination**:
- Double drops (14+14)
- Wait 30 minutes minimum
- For Crypto: 4 hours wait time

**Shelf Life**:
- Unopened: 4-5 years
- Opened: 1 year
- Mixed solution: Use within hours

### Katadyn Micropur Tablets

**Dosage**:
- 1 tablet per liter
- Wait 30 minutes (bacteria/viruses)
- Wait 4 hours (Giardia/Crypto)

**Features**:
- No mixing required
- Individually wrapped
- 5-year shelf life
- No taste after treatment

## Iodine (Traditional Method)

**Forms**:
- Tablets (Potable Aqua)
- Tincture (2% iodine solution)
- Crystals (Polar Pure)

### Potable Aqua Tablets

**Dosage**:
- 1 tablet per liter clear water
- 2 tablets per liter cloudy water
- Wait 30 minutes (10°C or warmer)
- Wait 60 minutes (cold water)

**Neutralizing Tablets** (PA Plus):
- Use after 30-60 min wait
- Removes iodine taste and color
- 1 neutralizing tablet per liter

### Tincture of Iodine (2%)

**Dosage**:
- Clear water: 5 drops per liter
- Cloudy water: 10 drops per liter
- Wait 30-60 minutes

**Advantages**:
- Cheap and widely available
- Dual use (water treatment + wound disinfection)
- Compact

**Disadvantages**:
- Strong taste
- Stains containers
- Health concerns for prolonged use

### Iodine Crystals (Polar Pure)

**How It Works**:
- Bottle contains iodine crystals
- Fill with water, shake
- Crystals create saturated solution
- Use solution to treat water (crystals stay in bottle)

**Dosage**:
- Read temperature scale on bottle
- Add indicated capfuls to water
- Recharge bottle with more water after each use
- Crystals last for ~2,000 liters

**Advantages**:
- Longest-lasting option
- Economical
- Precise dosing with temperature scale

**Who Should NOT Use Iodine**:
- Pregnant women
- People with thyroid conditions
- Those with iodine allergies
- Long-term use (>6 weeks continuous)

## Chlorine (Household Bleach)

**Important**: Use ONLY unscented, regular bleach (5-6% sodium hypochlorite)

**Dosage per Liter**:

Clear water:
- 2 drops of 5-6% bleach
- 4 drops of 1% bleach

Cloudy water:
- 4 drops of 5-6% bleach
- 8 drops of 1% bleach

**Process**:
1. Filter out sediment if cloudy
2. Add bleach drops
3. Stir or shake
4. Let stand 30 minutes
5. Should smell slightly of chlorine
6. If no chlorine smell, repeat dose and wait 15 more minutes

**Advantages**:
- Widely available
- Inexpensive
- Shelf-stable for months

**Disadvantages**:
- Must verify concentration
- Degrades over time (6-12 month shelf life opened)
- Can't use scented or "splashless" types
- Moderate chemical taste

### Bleach Concentration by Age

- Fresh: 5-6% use 2 drops/liter
- 6 months old: Use 4 drops/liter
- 1 year old: Use 6 drops/liter
- Over 1 year: Don't use (too weak)

## Aquatabs / NaDCC Tablets

**Active Ingredient**: Sodium Dichloroisocyanurate

**Dosage**:
- 1 tablet per liter (read package for size)
- Wait 30 minutes

**Advantages**:
- Stable (3-5 year shelf life)
- Individually wrapped
- Minimal taste (dissipates quickly)
- Easy to use
- Used by militaries and aid organizations

**Disadvantages**:
- Less effective against Crypto than chlorine dioxide
- Need different sizes for different volumes

## Pre-Treatment for Cloudy Water

Chemical treatment works best on clear water:

**Filter First**:
- Coffee filter
- Bandana or cloth
- Commercial filter
- Let settle 30+ minutes

**Double Chemical Dose**:
- If can't filter, use 2x normal chemical amount
- Increases wait time

**Why It Matters**:
- Particles shield pathogens
- Organic matter consumes chemicals
- Reduces effectiveness

## Wait Times by Water Temperature

**Cold Water** (< 4°C (cold water)):
- Double all wait times
- Chemical reactions slower in cold
- Consider boiling instead if very cold

**Warm Water** (> 15°C (warm water)):
- Standard wait times apply
- Reactions faster

**Hot Water** (> 27°C (hot water)):
- Minimum wait times sufficient
- Chlorine evaporates faster (seal container)

## Improving Taste

**Methods**:
- Neutralizing tablets (if available)
- Add vitamin C (ascorbic acid) after wait time
- Squeeze of lemon juice
- Flavoring powder (after treatment complete)
- Activated charcoal filter (post-treatment)
- Aerate by pouring between containers

**Timing**: Only add after full treatment time elapsed

## Combining Methods (Safest)

**Filter + Chemical**:
- Filter removes sediment and some pathogens
- Chemical kills what filter missed
- Shortest wait times
- Best taste

**Two Chemicals**:
- Not recommended (no added benefit)
- Can create harmful compounds
- Waste of resources

## Storage After Treatment

**Container**:
- Clean, covered container
- Don't recontaminate with dirty hands/cups
- Seal if possible

**Duration**:
- Use within 24-48 hours if possible
- Chlorine dissipates over time
- Re-treat if stored longer

## Emergency Improvised Methods

### Swimming Pool Shock (Calcium Hypochlorite)

**Only if no other option available**:
- Mix 1 heaping teaspoon in 2 gallons water (stock solution)
- Use 1 part stock to 100 parts water to treat
- Wait 30 minutes
- VERY strong - measure carefully

**Dangers**:
- Easy to overdose
- Caustic burns if too strong
- Only use as last resort

## Safety Considerations

**Overdosing**:
- Follow dosage exactly
- More ≠ better
- Can cause illness
- Damages equipment

**Allergies**:
- Some people allergic to iodine
- Carry alternatives
- Test before relying on one method

**Pregnancy/Children**:
- Avoid iodine
- Chlorine dioxide preferred
- Boiling safest

**Long-Term Use**:
- Rotate between methods if treating water for weeks
- Iodine: max 6 weeks continuous
- Chlorine methods: no limit but less ideal for taste

## Limitations

**What Chemicals DON'T Remove**:
- Heavy metals
- Chemical pollutants
- Pesticides/herbicides
- Radioactive particles
- Sediment

**When NOT to Rely on Chemicals**:
- Industrial pollution suspected
- Mining area runoff
- Agricultural chemical runoff
- Fuel/oil contamination
→ Find different source or use activated carbon + chemicals

## Field Testing

**Signs Treatment Worked**:
- Chlorine: Slight chlorine smell after wait time
- Iodine: Yellow tint, medicinal smell
- Chlorine dioxide: Minimal odor

**Signs of Problems**:
- No smell after chlorine treatment (add more)
- Excessive smell (too much added)
- Particles still floating (pre-filter better)

## Kit Recommendations

**Basic Kit**:
- Primary: Chlorine dioxide tablets (30-day supply)
- Backup: Tincture of iodine (2%)
- Emergency: Small bleach bottle + dropper

**Extended Kit**:
- Aquamira two-part drops (more doses)
- Potable Aqua tablets + neutralizers
- Coffee filters
- Dropper bottle

**Weight/Space**:
- 30-day chemical supply: 2-4 oz
- vs 30-day boiling fuel: pounds
- Chemicals win for weight-conscious trips

## Common Mistakes

**Not Waiting Long Enough**:
- Impatience defeats purpose
- Set timer, do other tasks

**Wrong Bleach Type**:
- Scented, splashless, or color-safe won't work
- Check ingredients: only sodium hypochlorite

**Treating Dirty Water**:
- Pre-filter always
- Doubles effectiveness

**Mixing Chemicals**:
- Don't combine different chemical types
- Can create toxic compounds
