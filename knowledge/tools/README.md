## ⚠️ Critical Safety Rules

### Edge Tool Safety:
- [ ] **Sharp is safer** - Dull tools slip, cause worse injuries
- [ ] **Cut away from body** - Always direct blade away from yourself
- [ ] **Clear cutting zone** - Arm's length radius + tool length
- [ ] **Stable platform** - Secure workpiece before cutting
- [ ] **One task at a time** - No talking while chopping/carving
- [ ] **Proper footwear** - Steel-toe or thick leather boots with axes

### Axe-Specific Rules:
- [ ] **Blood circle** - No one within 10 feet (3 meters) when swinging
- [ ] **Check overhead** - No branches to catch axe on backswing
- [ ] **Sharp axe** - Dull axes glance off, cause injuries
- [ ] **Two hands** - Always use both hands when swinging
- [ ] **Controlled swings** - Never swing harder than you can control
- [ ] **Inspect handle** - Check for cracks, loose head before every use

### Primitive Tool Safety:
- [ ] **Flint knapping** - Eye protection MANDATORY (sharp flakes fly)
- [ ] **Stone tools** - Expect them to break, no forceful use
- [ ] **Natural cordage** - Test strength before trusting life to it
- [ ] **Bow testing** - Gradual tillering, never dry-fire (bow explosion)
- [ ] **Leather tanning** - Chemicals/brain matter, gloves required

### Tool Maintenance:
- [ ] **Clean before storing** - Rust prevention (oil carbon steel)
- [ ] **Dry thoroughly** - Moisture = rust, especially folding tools
- [ ] **Inspect regularly** - Cracks, chips, handle integrity
- [ ] **Sharpen correctly** - Maintain proper bevel angle
- [ ] **Store safely** - Sheathed, locked, away from children

## 📖 Learning Tips

### Skill Development Progression:
1. **Master modern tools first** - Knife, axe, saw (foundation)
2. **Learn maintenance** - Sharpening before advanced techniques
3. **Add primitive skills** - Cordage, then baskets, then advanced crafts
4. **Practice in daylight** - Learn new techniques when you can see clearly
5. **Start small** - Carve spoons before carving bows

### Practice Drills:
- **Knife sharpening:** Practice until you can shave arm hair (test of sharpness)
- **Axe accuracy:** Hit same spot on log 10 times in a row
- **Cordage:** Make 10 feet of usable rope from plant fibers
- **Stone tools:** Knap a usable cutting edge (sharp enough to cut rope)
- **Basket weaving:** Make watertight basket (coat with pitch if needed)

### Common Mistakes:
1. **Rushing sharpening** - Low angle = sharp but fragile, high angle = dull but strong
2. **Over-swinging axe** - Control matters more than force
3. **Weak cordage** - Not twisting tight enough, poor fiber choice
4. **Improper tillering** - Bow breaks, dangerous projectile
5. **Skipping safety gear** - Eye protection for knapping, gloves for tanning

### Recommended Timeline:
- **Week 1:** Knife maintenance, basic sharpening
- **Month 1:** Axe use, saw techniques, tool care
- **Month 2-3:** Cordage making, basic improvised tools
- **Month 4-6:** Stone tools, basket weaving, rope making
- **6+ months:** Bow making, leather working, advanced primitive skills
- **1-2 years:** Master-level flint knapping, teaching others

### Reality Check:
- **Stone tool crafting:** 50+ hours to make first usable blade
- **Bow and arrow:** 20-40 hours for first functional bow
- **Hide tanning:** 3-5 days process time (weeks to master)
- **Basket weaving:** 10+ baskets to make watertight one
- **Cordage:** Fast to learn, lifetime to master different fibers
