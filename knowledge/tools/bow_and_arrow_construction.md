### Materials Needed

*   **Bow Stave (Wood)**:
    *   **Species**: Osage Orange, Yew, Black Locust, Hickory, Oak, Ash, Maple, Juniper, Elm, Mulberry. Look for dense, flexible woods.
    *   **Qualities**: A straight, knot-free section of a sapling or limb, approximately 1.5-2.5 inches in diameter and 5-6 feet long. The grain must run continuously from one end to the other. Ideally, partially seasoned wood (cut weeks/months prior) is best, but fresh wood can be worked carefully.
*   **Bow String Material**:
    *   **Natural Fibers**: Processed animal sinew (leg or back tendons), rawhide strips, inner bark fibers (nettle, dogbane, milkweed, cedar), or strong plant cordage.
*   **Arrow Shafts (Wood)**:
    *   **Species**: Dogwood, Wild Rose, Hazel, Viburnum, Elderberry, Willow.
    *   **Qualities**: Straight, knot-free shoots, approximately 1/4 - 3/8 inch in diameter and 28-32 inches long (depending on draw length).
*   **Fletching Material**:
    *   **Feathers**: Large flight feathers from birds (turkey, goose, raven). Need 3 per arrow.
*   **Arrowhead Material**:
    *   **Stone**: Flint, Chert, Obsidian, Jasper (requires flintknapping skills).
    *   **Bone**: Sharpened bone fragments.
    *   **Hardened Wood**: Sharpened tip hardened by fire.
*   **Binding/Glue**:
    *   **Sinew**: Thin strips of animal sinew.
    *   **Pine Pitch Glue**: Pine resin mixed with charcoal and animal fat (heated).
    *   **Rawhide Strips**: Thin strips for lashing.
*   **Tools**:
    *   **Cutting/Carving Tool**: Sharp knife (stone or metal blade), or a sharp stone flake.
    *   **Scraper**: Stone flake or metal edge for removing wood.
    *   **Smoother/Sander**: Rough stone, coarse plant material, or sand for finishing.
    *   **Heat Source**: Small fire or coals for straightening arrow shafts and hardening wooden points.
    *   **Tillering Device (Optional but Recommended)**: A sturdy post with a marked scale to gauge limb bend.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Part 1: Crafting the Bow

##### 1. Stave Selection and Preparation

1.  **Identify Potential Staves**: Look for suitable wood species. The stave must be free of knots, twists, or significant damage. A slight natural curve can be advantageous, aligning with the "belly" (inner curve) of the bow.
2.  **Rough Cut**: Cut a section of wood that is about 1 foot longer than your target bow length (usually 5-6 feet for a full-size bow).
3.  **Debark and Seal (If Seasoning)**: Remove the bark. If you have time to season the wood, seal the ends with pitch or wax to prevent rapid drying and cracking. Store in a cool, dry place for several weeks or months. For immediate use, proceed carefully.
4.  **Define Back and Belly**: The back of the bow is the side facing away from you when drawn (the outer growth rings). The belly is the side facing you (the inner growth rings). Never cut into the back's integrity, as this is where tension is held.

##### 2. Initial Shaping and Layout

1.  **Mark the Center**: Find the middle of your stave. This will be the grip.
2.  **Define Limbs and Grip**: Mark out the grip section (4-6 inches wide) and the two limbs extending outwards. The limbs should taper slightly from the grip towards the tips.
3.  **Remove Excess Wood**: Using your knife and scraper, carefully remove wood from the sides and belly of the stave, roughing out the bow's shape. The back of the bow must remain intact with its natural growth ring layer. Gradually reduce the width and thickness of the limbs.

##### 3. Tillering (The Critical Step)

Tillering is the process of gradually removing wood from the belly of the limbs to ensure they bend evenly and smoothly when the bow is drawn. This prevents one limb from breaking prematurely.
1.  **Create a Tillering String**: Tie a temporary string to the ends of the bow with simple loops.
2.  **Set Up Tillering Device**: Use a tillering stick or tree with a scale marked in inches. Hang the bow upside down (belly facing you), hook the tillering string to the appropriate mark, and gently pull down on the handle.
3.  **Observe the Bend**: Start with a very short draw (e.g., 6-10 inches). Observe which parts of the limbs are stiff and which are bending too much.
4.  **Scrape and Re-Check**: Use a scraper to carefully remove small amounts of wood *only* from the stiff areas of the belly. Never scrape the back. Check both limbs for symmetry and evenness.
5.  **Gradual Increase**: Gradually increase the draw length by a few inches at a time, continually scraping and checking the bend. Aim for an even, elliptical curve across both limbs. This is the most time-consuming and delicate part of bow construction. A single incorrect scrape can ruin the bow.
6.  **Full Draw**: Continue until the bow can be drawn to your full desired draw length (e.g., 28-30 inches) with an even bend and no signs of stress or hinging (parts that bend too sharply).

##### 4. Creating Nocks and Final Finish

1.  **Cut String Nocks**: Carefully carve small, shallow grooves (nocks) into the tips of the bow limbs for the bowstring. These should be smooth and deep enough to hold the string without cutting it.
2.  **Smooth the Bow**: Use fine abrasive stone or rough plant material to smooth the entire bow, especially the handle and string nocks, to prevent splinters and provide comfort.

##### 5. Making the Bowstring

1.  **Process Fibers**: Twist together natural fibers (sinew is strongest) into a thin, strong cord. For sinew, shred it into strands, moisten slightly, and twist.
2.  **Length and Loops**: Make the string slightly shorter than the unstrung bow. Form loops at each end to fit into the nocks. The string should be strong enough to withstand the bow's full draw weight.

##### 6. Bracing the Bow

1.  **String the Bow**: Carefully put the string on the nocks. It should hold the bow under slight tension, forming a small gap (brace height, typically 5-7 inches) between the string and the grip.
2.  **Test Gently**: Draw the bow a few times to ensure the string holds and the limbs continue to bend evenly.

#### Part 2: Crafting the Arrows

##### 1. Shaft Selection and Straightening

1.  **Gather Shoots**: Collect straight, blemish-free shoots of suitable diameter and length.
2.  **Heat Straighten**: Gently heat sections of the shaft over a low fire or coals. As the wood warms, use your hands to carefully bend and straighten any kinks or curves. Hold it straight until it cools. Repeat until perfectly straight.
3.  **Smooth and Point**: Scrape and smooth the shafts. For simple hunting arrows, sharpen one end to a fine point. This point can be hardened by charring it briefly in fire and then scraping the charred layer.

##### 2. Fletching (Stabilization)

1.  **Prepare Feathers**: Find three suitable flight feathers. Split them down the middle and trim them to about 4-6 inches.
2.  **Attach Fletching**: Glue or bind the feathers onto the back (nock end) of the arrow shaft. Space them evenly around the shaft, about 1/2 inch from the nock. Orient them slightly spiraled for better rotation and flight stability. Use thin sinew or fine cordage to tightly lash the base and tip of each feather.

##### 3. Arrowhead Attachment

1.  **Prepare Shaft Tip**: If using a stone or bone arrowhead, split the tip of the arrow shaft slightly (about 1-2 inches deep).
2.  **Insert and Bind**: Insert the arrowhead into the split. Use wet sinew or thin rawhide to tightly wrap and lash the arrowhead securely in place. As the sinew dries, it will shrink and create an incredibly strong bond. For added security, apply pine pitch glue over the sinew wrapping.
3.  **Wooden Points**: If using a fire-hardened wooden point, no separate attachment is needed; simply ensure it's sharpened and hardened effectively.

##### 4. Nocking the Arrow

1.  **Carve Nock**: Carefully carve a small, shallow notch into the very end of the arrow shaft, opposite the arrowhead. This nock must fit your bowstring snugly but not so tightly that it damages the string.

### Safety Considerations

*   **Bow Failure**: A poorly tillered or overdrawn bow can snap, sending splinters and parts flying. Always wear eye protection during tillering and initial draws.
*   **Dry Firing**: Never "dry fire" a bow (draw and release without an arrow). This stores enormous energy in the limbs, which is violently released into the bow itself without an arrow to absorb it, often causing catastrophic damage to the bow and potential injury.
*   **Arrow Inspection**: Always inspect arrows before shooting. Cracked, splintered, or damaged arrows can break on release, sending sharp pieces into your hand.
*   **Shooting Environment**: Always be aware of your surroundings. Ensure a clear path to your target and a safe, effective backstop that will stop the arrow. Never shoot at unknown targets or where people or animals might be unseen.
*   **Tool Safety**: Exercise extreme caution when using knives and sharp scraping tools during construction.

### Common Mistakes

*   **Poor Wood Selection**: Choosing knotty, twisted, or inappropriate wood species will result in a weak, unreliable, or quickly broken bow.
*   **Cutting the Back of the Bow**: Never violate the continuous growth ring on the back of the bow. This is its tension bearing layer.
*   **Improper Tillering**: The most common mistake. Uneven tillering leads to "hinging" (over-bending in one spot), poor performance, and eventually bow breakage. Patience is key.
*   **Over-Thick/Over-Thin Limbs**: Limbs too thick result in a bow that is hard to draw and low power. Limbs too thin will break.
*   **Weak Bowstring**: A poorly made or weak string can snap during draw, potentially causing serious injury.
*   **Unstraight Arrows**: Arrows that are not perfectly straight will fly erratically and be inaccurate.
*   **Loose Arrowheads**: An arrowhead that detaches on impact is useless and a waste of effort. Ensure secure binding.
*   **Rushing the Process**: Every step requires care and attention. Rushing leads to critical errors and a dangerous or ineffective tool.
