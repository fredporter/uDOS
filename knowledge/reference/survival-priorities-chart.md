# Survival Priorities Reference Chart

**Quick Reference:** Critical survival priorities and timelines

---

## Rule of 3s (Survival Timeline)

| Priority | Timeline | Critical Actions |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Air** | 3 minutes | Clear airway, CPR, breathing assistance |
| **Shelter** | 3 hours | Protection from elements, hypothermia/hyperthermia prevention |
| **Water** | 3 days | Find, purify, store water sources |
| **Food** | 3 weeks | Foraging, hunting, fishing, rationing |
| **Hope/Morale** | 3 months | Mental health, purpose, community |

### Priority Pyramid (Visual)

```
					[ AIR ]      3 minutes
				[ SHELTER ]    3 hours
			[  WATER  ]      3 days
		[   FOOD   ]       3 weeks
	[ HOPE/MORALE ]      3 months
```

### Immediate Priority Flowchart

```diagram flowchart
START: Assess immediate survival risks
STEP: Is airway/breathing compromised? → Secure AIR first
STEP: Is exposure life-threatening? → Build SHELTER
STEP: Is dehydration imminent? → Find and purify WATER
STEP: Is energy failing over days? → Source FOOD
END: Stabilize morale and long-term plan
```

## Resource Rationing Guide

### Water Rationing (Limited Supply)
| Supply Duration | Daily Ration | Strategy |
|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| 1-2 days | No rationing | Find new source immediately |
| 3-5 days | 50% reduction | Minimize exertion, find source |
| 6-10 days | 75% reduction | Emergency conservation mode |
| >10 days | Survival minimum | Critical - all effort to water |

**Rationing Tips:**
- Drink at regular intervals (don't gulp)
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine
- Minimize sweating (work in cool hours)
- Moisten lips, don't waste drinking
- Use water efficiently (cooking, washing)

### Food Rationing
| Supply Duration | Daily Calories | Strategy |
|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| 1-3 days | Normal intake | Establish foraging/hunting |
| 4-7 days | 75% intake | Begin supplementing |
| 1-2 weeks | 50% intake | Focus on high-fat foods |
| 2-4 weeks | 25-50% | Survival mode, conserve energy |

## Energy Conservation

### Activity Energy Costs (Relative)
| Activity | Energy Cost | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Resting | 1x baseline | Lying down, minimal movement |
| Sitting | 1.2x | Light tasks, planning |
| Walking (flat) | 3-4x | Normal pace |
| Walking (terrain) | 5-8x | Hills, obstacles |
| Running | 8-12x | Avoid unless emergency |
| Shelter building | 6-10x | Heavy work |
| Digging | 10-15x | Extreme exertion |

**Energy Conservation Rules:**
1. Work during coolest hours (dawn/dusk)
2. Rest during heat of day
3. Pace yourself - slow and steady
4. Avoid unnecessary movement
5. Plan routes efficiently
6. Share work in groups

## Hypothermia Prevention Timeline

| Core Temp | Time to Incapacitation | Symptoms | Action Required |
|-----------|------------------------|----------|-----------------|
| 37°C (98.6°F) | Normal | None | Maintain |
| 36°C (96.8°F) | 1-2 hours | Shivering, cold | Shelter, warm |
| 35°C (95°F) | 30-60 min | Violent shivering | Immediate shelter |
| 34°C (93.2°F) | 15-30 min | Confusion, slurred | Emergency heat |
| 33°C (91.4°F) | 10-15 min | Drowsiness, weak | Critical - life threat |
| 32°C (89.6°F) | <10 min | Unconsciousness | Medical emergency |
| <32°C | Minutes | Cardiac arrest risk | CPR, external heat |

**Prevention is Critical:** Once below 35°C, self-rescue becomes extremely difficult.

## Dehydration Assessment

| % Dehydration | Symptoms | Functional Impact | Urgency |
|---------------|----------|-------------------|---------|
| 1-2% | Thirst, reduced performance | Mild cognitive decline | Monitor |
| 3-4% | Dry mouth, fatigue | Significant performance loss | Find water |
| 5-6% | Dizziness, headache | Coordination problems | Urgent |
| 7-8% | Severe weakness | Incapacitation risk | Critical |
| 9-10% | Muscle spasms, delirium | Imminent collapse | Emergency |
| >10% | Organ failure | Death risk | Life-threatening |

**Field Test:** Pinch skin on back of hand - if it stays "tented" for >2 seconds, you're dehydrated.

## Signal-to-Noise Ratio (Rescue Visibility)

### Visual Signals (Daytime)
| Method | Visibility Range | Duration | Effectiveness |
|--------|------------------|----------|---------------|
| Signal mirror | 10-50 km | Hours | Excellent (clear day) |
| Smoke (dark) | 5-20 km | Hours | Good (light background) |
| Smoke (white) | 3-15 km | Hours | Good (dark background) |
| Ground markers | 1-5 km | Days | Moderate (aerial view) |
| Bright clothing | 0.5-2 km | Permanent | Low (passive) |

### Audio Signals
| Method | Range | Duration | Effectiveness |
|--------|-------|----------|---------------|
| Whistle | 1-3 km | Hours | Excellent |
| Shouting | 0.3-1 km | Minutes | Poor (tiring) |
| Banging metal | 0.5-2 km | Hours | Moderate |

### Night Signals
| Method | Range | Duration | Effectiveness |
|--------|-------|----------|---------------|
| Flashlight (SOS) | 5-15 km | Hours | Excellent |
| Fire | 10-30 km | Hours | Very Good |
| Strobe/flare | 15-50 km | Minutes | Excellent |

**SOS Signal:** 3 short, 3 long, 3 short (... --- ...) - Universal distress

2. Last known position? → Yes: backtrack / No: stay put
3. Shelter needed soon? → Yes: build / No: plan
4. Signaling possible? → Yes: deploy / No: conserve energy
5. Resources adequate? → Yes: wait rescue / No: careful movement
