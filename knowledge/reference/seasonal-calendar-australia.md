## Overview

Australia's seasons are opposite to the Northern Hemisphere, and climates vary dramatically from tropical north to temperate south. This guide provides month-by-month planning for gardening, foraging, and preparation.

**Climate Zones (simplified):**
- **Tropical** (Darwin, Cairns) - Wet/Dry seasons
- **Subtropical** (Brisbane, northern NSW) - Mild winters
- **Temperate** (Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth) - Four distinct seasons
- **Cool** (Hobart, alpine areas) - Cold winters

**Key Principle:** "Work with nature's rhythm, not against it."

**Remember:** These are general guidelines. Observe YOUR local conditions:
- Frost dates vary (suburb to suburb)
- Microclimates exist (sunny wall vs shaded corner)
- Experiment and record (garden journal invaluable)

**Your best teacher: Your own garden, over multiple seasons.**
