Practical field reference for navigation without GPS or modern tools. Designed for quick consultation during actual navigation scenarios.

---

## Solar Navigation

### Watch Method (Northern Hemisphere)

1. Point hour hand at sun
2. Bisect angle between hour hand and 12
3. Line points south
4. Accuracy: ±15° (best at solar noon)

### Watch Method (Southern Hemisphere)

1. Point 12 at sun
2. Bisect angle between 12 and hour hand
3. Line points north
4. Accuracy: ±15°

**Daylight Savings:** Use standard time (subtract 1 hour)

### Shadow Stick Method

**Quick Version (15 minutes):**
1. Place vertical stick in flat ground
2. Mark shadow tip (mark 1)
3. Wait 15 minutes
4. Mark new shadow tip (mark 2)
5. Line from mark 1 to mark 2 = east-west line (W→E)

**Accurate Version (2+ hours):**
1. Morning: Mark shadow tip every 30 minutes
2. Draw arc through all marks
3. Afternoon: Shadow will cross arc at same point
4. Line from center = true north-south

**Accuracy:** ±5° with 2+ hour method

### Sun Position by Time

| Time | Direction (N. Hem) | Azimuth |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| 6:00 | East | 90° |
| 9:00 | Southeast | 135° |
| 12:00 | South | 180° |
| 15:00 | Southwest | 225° |
| 18:00 | West | 270° |

**Southern Hemisphere:** Reverse (sun north at noon)

---

## Celestial Navigation

### Southern Cross Method

**Visibility:** Year-round south of equator, best 20-45°S

**Finding South:**
1. Locate Southern Cross (4 bright stars, kite shape)
2. Find "Pointers" (Alpha & Beta Centauri)
3. Extend long axis of cross 4.5× its length
4. Draw perpendicular from pointers midpoint
5. Lines intersect = celestial south pole
6. Drop vertical to horizon = south

**Accuracy:** ±5° with practice

**False Cross Warning:** Smaller, dimmer, wider stars - use Pointers to confirm

### Orion's Belt Method

**Visibility:** Worldwide, best October-March

1. Find Orion's three-star belt
2. Belt rises in east, sets in west
3. Mintaka (western star) rises within 1° of true east
4. Perpendicular to belt at horizon = north-south line

**Accuracy:** ±10°

### Moon Phases for Direction

| Phase | Rising | Setting | Midnight Position |
|-------|--------|---------|------------------|
| New | 6am | 6pm | Not visible |
| First Quarter | Noon | Midnight | North (S. Hem) |
| Full | 6pm | 6am | North (S. Hem) |
| Last Quarter | Midnight | Noon | North (S. Hem) |

**Horns Point:** Crescent "horns" point toward sun direction

## Magnetic Navigation

### Compass Basics

**Magnetic Declination (Australia):**
- Eastern states: 10-13°E (add to magnetic bearing)
- Western Australia: 0-2°W (subtract)
- Annual change: ~0.1° westward

**Taking a Bearing:**
1. Hold compass level at waist height
2. Point direction-of-travel arrow at landmark
3. Rotate bezel until red needle aligns with orienting arrow
4. Read bearing at index line
5. Add/subtract declination for true bearing

**Following a Bearing:**
1. Set bearing on compass
2. Hold compass level
3. Rotate body until red needle aligns
4. Walk toward direction-of-travel arrow
5. Pick intermediate landmarks every 50-100m

### Magnetic Interference

**Avoid within 5 meters:**
- Metal objects (vehicles, tools, belt buckles)
- Electronic devices (phones, GPS, radios)
- Power lines, pipelines
- Iron-rich rocks (basalt, magnetite)

**Testing:** Take bearing, rotate 180°, reverse compass. Should read same ±5°.

## Natural Indicators

### Vegetation Indicators (Southern Hemisphere)

| Indicator | North Side | South Side |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Tree bark | Lighter, smoother | Darker, rougher |
| Moss growth | Less moss | More moss (moisture) |
| Branch density | Denser foliage | Sparser |
| Anthills/termites | Oriented N-S | Steep on east |

**Reliability:** 60-70% - use multiple indicators

### Wind Patterns

**Prevailing Winds (Australia):**
- Summer: Northerly/northwesterly (warm)
- Winter: Southerly/southwesterly (cool)
- Coastal: Sea breeze afternoon (from ocean)
- Morning: Land breeze (from land)

**Trade Winds (Tropics 0-30°):**
- Northern Hemisphere: Northeast
- Southern Hemisphere: Southeast

### Cloud Indicators

**Direction Clues:**
- Lenticular clouds: Form perpendicular to wind
- Stratocumulus streets: Align with wind direction
- Storm fronts: Move west→east (midlatitudes)

---

## Distance Estimation

### Pace Counting

**Calibrate Your Pace:**
1. Measure 100m flat course
2. Walk normal speed, count each time right foot hits ground
3. Repeat 3 times, average = your 100m pace count
4. Typical: 60-65 paces per 100m

**Terrain Adjustments:**
- Uphill 20%: Add 12-13 paces per 100m
- Downhill 20%: Subtract 8-10 paces
- Dense bush: Add 15-20 paces
- Snow/sand: Add 20-25 paces

**Tracking:** Use pebbles/sticks - move one every 100m

### Visual Distance Estimation

| Object Visibility | Approximate Distance |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Person's face recognizable | 50-100m |
| Person's body visible | 500-1000m |
| Person's movement visible | 1500-2000m |
| Large building detail | 2-3km |
| Large building outline | 8-10km |

**Multipliers:**
- Clear day: × 1.0
- Hazy: × 0.7
- After rain: × 1.3 (appears closer)
- Across water: × 0.6 (appears farther)

## Terrain Association

### Handrail Navigation

**Definition:** Following linear features

**Good Handrails:**
- Rivers, creeks (flow downhill)
- Ridgelines (high visibility)
- Roads, trails, fence lines
- Coastlines, lakeshores
- Power lines, pipelines

**Technique:**
1. Identify handrail on map
2. Move to handrail
3. Follow to destination or intersection
4. Verify with terrain features

### Catching Features

**Definition:** Large, obvious features past destination

**Examples:**
- Major road (if walking to trail junction)
- River (if seeking campsite on tributary)
- Cliff line (if navigating plateau)
- Coastline (if traveling inland)

**Use:** If you hit catching feature, you overshot - backtrack

### Attack Points

**Definition:** Easy-to-find feature near destination

**Technique:**
1. Navigate to obvious attack point (road junction, bridge, hilltop)
2. Take precise bearing to destination
3. Use fine navigation for final approach
4. Reduces cumulative error

---

## Emergency Position Finding

### Baseline Method

**When:** Lost but know general area

1. Identify major linear feature on map (road, river, coastline)
2. Determine which side you're on
3. Travel perpendicular until you hit feature
4. Follow feature to known point
5. Reorient

**Example:** Lost in forest, but know you're east of Highway 1. Walk west until highway, then use signs to determine position.

### Triangulation (Resection)

**Requirements:** Compass + 2-3 visible, identifiable landmarks

1. Take bearing to landmark A
2. Reverse bearing (add/subtract 180°)
3. Draw line on map from landmark A at reversed bearing
4. Repeat for landmarks B and C
5. Lines intersect = your position

**Accuracy:** ±100m with practice

### GPS Coordinate Backup

**Without GPS Unit:**
1. Note sun position + time = rough direction
2. Estimate distance traveled (pace count × terrain factor)
3. Dead reckoning from last known point
4. Cross-reference with terrain features

---

## Navigation in Poor Visibility

### Fog/Whiteout

**Techniques:**
1. Compass-only navigation (no visual references)
2. Leapfrog method: Team member walks ahead to visible limit, you navigate to them
3. Handrail navigation (follow stream, ridge)
4. Reduce pace, increase accuracy
5. Use altimeter to confirm elevation changes

### Night Navigation

**Without Light:**
1. Allow 20-30 min for dark adaptation
2. Use peripheral vision (better night sensitivity)
3. Celestial navigation (stars, moon)
4. Listen for water, roads, civilization
5. Feel terrain with feet

**With Light:**
1. Use red light (preserves night vision)
2. Navigate by compass bearing between visible points
3. Mark route with glow sticks if returning

---

## Route Selection

### Terrain Analysis

**Easiest Routes:**
- Valley floors (following water)
- Ridgelines (good visibility, less vegetation)
- Trails, game tracks (animals choose efficient routes)

**Avoid:**
- Dense vegetation (swamps, rainforest)
- Steep slopes >30° (exhausting, dangerous)
- Loose scree, boulder fields
- Areas between contours (dead ground, hidden hazards)

### Energy Conservation

**Contouring:** Walking around hill at constant elevation
- Saves energy vs. up/down
- Longer distance, but faster overall
- Good when traversing multiple spurs

**Naismith's Rule (Time Estimation):**
- Base: 5 km/h on flat ground = 12 min/km
- Add 10 minutes per 100m ascent
- Add 10 minutes per 200m descent (steep)

**Example:** 8km hike with 400m ascent
- Flat time: 8km × 12 min = 96 min
- Ascent: 400m × 10 min/100m = 40 min
- **Total: 136 min (2h 16min)**

## Map Reading Essentials

### Contour Interpretation

| Pattern | Terrain |
|---------|---------|
| Circles, close together | Peak, hill |
| Circles, spaced apart | Gentle hill |
| V-shape, pointing uphill | Valley, gully |
| V-shape, pointing downhill | Spur, ridge |
| Lines very close | Cliff, steep slope |
| Lines far apart | Gentle slope, flat |

**Slope Angle Estimation:**
- 1 contour/cm @ 1:25,000 (10m interval) = 23° slope
- 2+ contours/cm = Very steep (30-45°)

### Grid References

**6-Figure Grid (100m precision):**
1. Find grid square (e.g., 5246)
2. Divide square into tenths mentally
3. Estimate eastings (52 + 7 tenths = 527)
4. Estimate northings (46 + 3 tenths = 463)
5. **Grid Reference: 527463**

**8-Figure Grid (10m precision):** Divide tenths into tenths (5274 4638)

## Emergency Signals

### Ground-to-Air Signals

**Size:** Minimum 3m × 0.5m per symbol
**Spacing:** 3m between symbols
**Materials:** Contrast with ground (rocks, logs, clothing, fire, snow)

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| I | Serious injury, need doctor |
| II | Need medical supplies |
| F | Need food and water |
| X | Unable to proceed |
| ↑ | Proceeding this direction |
| LL | All well |
| N | No |
| Y | Yes |
| △ | Safe to land here |

**International Distress:**
- SOS (· · · — — — · · ·)
- Triangle of fires (50m apart)
- 3 of anything (whistles, flashes, smoke)

## Safety Notes

⚠️ **Never rely on single method** - Use 3+ navigation techniques simultaneously
⚠️ **Magnetic anomalies** - Australia has areas with local magnetic variation
⚠️ **Bush fires** - Smoke obscures sun/stars, creates unpredictable winds
⚠️ **If lost:** STOP (Stop, Think, Observe, Plan) - Don't panic navigate
⚠️ **Phone GPS** - Battery dies fast, download offline maps before trip
