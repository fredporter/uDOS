## MARCH Protocol (Life-Threatening First)

**Priority Order for Casualties:**

| Letter | Priority | Action | Time Critical |
|--------|----------|--------|---------------|
| **M** | Massive Hemorrhage | Stop severe bleeding | 1-2 minutes |
| **A** | Airway | Clear airway obstruction | 3-4 minutes |
| **R** | Respiration | Treat breathing problems | 5-10 minutes |
| **C** | Circulation | Treat shock, fluid loss | 15-30 minutes |
| **H** | Hypothermia/Head | Prevent heat loss, protect spine | 1-3 hours |

**Memory Aid:** "Major bleeding kills fastest, then breathing, then shock"

---

## Massive Hemorrhage Control

### Direct Pressure

**Technique:**
1. Apply direct pressure with clean cloth/bandage
2. Press hard directly on wound
3. Don't remove first dressing (add more on top)
4. Maintain pressure 10-15 minutes minimum
5. Bandage firmly once bleeding controlled

**Pressure Points (if direct pressure fails):**
- **Arm:** Brachial artery (inside of upper arm)
- **Leg:** Femoral artery (groin crease)
- Press artery against bone

### Tourniquet Application

**When:** Severe limb bleeding not controlled by pressure, multiple casualties, unsafe to stay

**Improvised Tourniquet:**
1. Use 5cm+ wide material (belt, cloth strip, NOT rope/wire)
2. Place 5-7cm ABOVE wound (between wound and heart)
3. Wrap twice, tie half-knot
4. Place stick on knot, tie full knot over stick
5. Twist stick until bleeding stops
6. Secure stick so it can't unwind
7. Mark time applied on casualty's forehead (use blood if needed)
8. **DO NOT REMOVE** - medical personnel only

**Commercial Tourniquet (CAT):**
1. Place 5-7cm above wound
2. Route through buckle, pull very tight
3. Twist windlass until bleeding stops
4. Lock windlass in keeper
5. Note time applied

⚠️ **Time Limit:** Can remain for 2 hours safely, up to 6 hours with risk

### Wound Packing (Junctional Hemorrhage)

**When:** Armpit, groin, neck wounds (can't tourniquet)

1. Apply direct pressure
2. Pack gauze/clean cloth deep into wound
3. Keep packing until wound filled
4. Apply pressure on top 3+ minutes
5. Bandage firmly over packing
6. Monitor for re-bleeding

## Airway Management

### Unconscious Casualty - Recovery Position

**Check Responsiveness:**
- Shout: "Can you hear me?"
- Squeeze shoulders
- Painful stimulus (sternum rub)

**If Unresponsive + Breathing:**
1. Kneel beside casualty
2. Extend arm nearest you at right angle
3. Bring far arm across chest, place back of hand against near cheek
4. Bend far knee up
5. Roll casualty toward you by pulling far knee
6. Tilt head back gently to open airway
7. Monitor breathing continuously

**If Unresponsive + NOT Breathing:**
→ **START CPR** (see below)

### Choking (Conscious Adult)

**Signs:** Can't speak, grasping throat, silent cough, blue lips

**Back Blows (5 times):**
1. Lean person forward
2. Heel of hand between shoulder blades
3. Sharp upward blows

**Abdominal Thrusts (5 times):**
1. Stand behind, arms around waist
2. Fist above navel, below ribcage
3. Grasp fist with other hand
4. Quick inward and upward thrusts

**Repeat:** 5 back blows → 5 thrusts → repeat until clear or unconscious

**If Unconscious:** Lower to ground, start CPR (chest compressions may dislodge object)

---

## CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)

### Adult CPR (DRSABCD)

**D - Danger:** Ensure area safe
**R - Response:** Check responsiveness
**S - Send for help:** Call 000
**A - Airway:** Open airway (head tilt, chin lift)
**B - Breathing:** Check for breathing (10 seconds max)
**C - CPR:** If not breathing normally
**D - Defibrillation:** Use AED if available

### Compression Technique

**Hand Position:**
- Center of chest (lower half of breastbone)
- Heel of one hand, other hand on top
- Interlock fingers, keep off ribs

**Compression:**
- **Depth:** 5-6cm (1/3 chest depth)
- **Rate:** 100-120 per minute (Stayin' Alive tempo)
- **Ratio:** 30 compressions : 2 breaths
- **Release:** Allow full chest recoil between compressions

**Rescue Breaths:**
1. Tilt head back, lift chin
2. Pinch nose closed
3. Seal mouth over theirs
4. Blow for 1 second (chest should rise)
5. Give 2 breaths

**If untrained or unwilling:** Compression-only CPR (skip breaths)

**Continue until:**
- Casualty starts breathing
- Medical help arrives
- Too exhausted to continue
- Scene becomes unsafe

### Child CPR (1-12 years)

- Use one hand for compressions if small child
- Compress 1/3 chest depth (~5cm)
- 30:2 ratio (same as adult)
- Breath more gently

### Infant CPR (Under 1 year)

- Use 2 fingers for compressions
- Compress 1/3 chest depth (~4cm)
- 30:2 ratio
- Puff breaths (less volume)

---

## Shock Management

### Recognizing Shock

**Signs:**
- Pale, cold, clammy skin
- Rapid, weak pulse (>100 bpm)
- Rapid, shallow breathing
- Confusion, anxiety
- Thirst, nausea
- Weakness, dizziness

**Causes:** Blood loss, dehydration, severe pain, allergic reaction, heart attack

### Treatment

1. **Lie flat** (unless breathing difficulty or vomiting)
2. **Elevate legs** 30cm (improves blood to vital organs)
3. **Loosen tight clothing** (belt, collar)
4. **Keep warm** (blanket under and over)
5. **NO food or drink** (may need surgery)
6. **Reassure** (reduces anxiety)
7. **Monitor** breathing, pulse every 5 minutes
8. **Get help** urgently

**Exception:** Head injury, stroke, breathing difficulty → keep flat or slightly raised head

## Burns

### Classification

| Degree | Depth | Appearance | Pain |
|--------|-------|------------|------|
| 1st | Epidermis only | Red, dry | Very painful |
| 2nd | Partial thickness | Blisters, red/white | Extremely painful |
| 3rd | Full thickness | White/black, leathery | Less pain (nerves destroyed) |

### Treatment (All Burns)

**Immediate:**
1. **Remove from heat source** (stop, drop, roll if on fire)
2. **Cool for 20 minutes** with cool running water (not ice)
3. **Remove jewelry/tight items** before swelling
4. **Cover loosely** with clean, non-stick material (cling film works)
5. **DO NOT:** Pop blisters, apply ice, apply creams/butter

**Seek Medical Help If:**
- Larger than palm of hand
- On face, hands, feet, genitals, joints
- 3rd degree (any size)
- Chemical or electrical burn
- Child or elderly
- Infected (pus, increasing pain, red streaks)

### Chemical Burns

1. Brush off dry powder first
2. Flush with water 20+ minutes (longer for alkali burns)
3. Remove contaminated clothing while flushing
4. DO NOT neutralize (creates more heat)

### Electrical Burns

1. **DO NOT TOUCH** if still in contact with source
2. Turn off power or remove with non-conductive object (wood)
3. Check for breathing, start CPR if needed
4. Assume internal injuries (electrical current travels through body)
5. **All electrical burns need hospital assessment**

## Fractures and Dislocations

### Recognizing Fractures

**Signs:**
- Deformity, unnatural position
- Swelling, bruising
- Pain with movement or pressure
- Grinding sensation (crepitus)
- Loss of function
- Bone protruding (open fracture)

### General Fracture Treatment

1. **Immobilize** injury in position found
2. **Support** above and below fracture
3. **Pad** with soft material (clothing, blankets)
4. **Secure** with bandages/improvised splints
5. **Check circulation** (pulse, color, warmth) below injury
6. **Elevate** if possible (reduces swelling)
7. **Ice** (20 min on, 20 min off) - protect skin

**DO NOT:**
- Try to straighten (unless no pulse and medical help hours away)
- Move casualty unless necessary
- Give food/drink (may need surgery)

### Open Fractures

**Bone exposed through skin - HIGH INFECTION RISK**

1. **DO NOT** push bone back in
2. Cover wound with sterile dressing
3. Build padding around bone (don't press on it)
4. Immobilize as per closed fracture
5. **URGENT medical help** - IV antibiotics needed

### Improvised Splints

**Materials:** Sticks, trekking poles, cardboard, rolled newspaper, foam mat

**Principles:**
- Immobilize joint above and below fracture
- Pad bony prominences
- Tie above and below fracture (not directly on it)
- Check circulation after splinting

**Sling for Arm:**
1. Support arm at 90° across chest
2. Triangular bandage under arm, ends over shoulder
3. Tie at side of neck (NOT back - painful to lie on)
4. Pin or tie point at elbow

## Snake Bite (Australian Pressure Immobilization)

### Recognition

**Elapid Snakes (venomous Australian):**
- Fang marks (may be small, hard to see)
- Local pain, swelling (may be minimal initially)
- Nausea, vomiting
- Headache, abdominal pain
- Vision disturbances
- Breathing difficulty (late sign - URGENT)

⚠️ **ALL Australian snake bites are potentially lethal - treat as venomous**

### Treatment - Pressure Immobilization Technique (PIT)

**DO:**
1. **Keep calm, still** (movement spreads venom)
2. Apply firm elasticized bandage over bite site
3. Bandage entire limb (start at fingers/toes, work up)
4. Apply as tight as for sprained ankle (can slip finger under)
5. Splint limb to prevent movement
6. Mark bite site on bandage
7. **Keep completely still** - carry if possible
8. Get to hospital urgently

**DO NOT:**
- Wash bite area (prevents venom ID)
- Cut, suck, or tourniquet
- Remove bandage (only hospital staff)
- Allow movement
- Apply ice

**If No Bandage:** Use clothing strips, shirt torn in strips

### Spider Bites

**Funnel-Web / Mouse Spider:** PIT (same as snake)
**Redback Spider:** Ice pack, pain relief, get medical help (no PIT)
**Other Spiders:** Ice, monitor, seek medical advice

## Hypothermia

### Stages

| Stage | Core Temp | Signs | Action |
|-------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Mild | 35-32°C | Shivering, cold, clumsy | Warm actively |
| Moderate | 32-28°C | Stop shivering, confused, drowsy | Gentle warming, hospital |
| Severe | <28°C | Unconscious, rigid, weak pulse | CPR if no pulse, hospital |

### Treatment

**Mild Hypothermia:**
1. Move to shelter, out of wind/rain
2. Remove wet clothing
3. Warm with dry clothing, blankets
4. Warm drinks (NO alcohol, caffeine)
5. High-energy food
6. Warm water bottles (protect skin - wrap in cloth)
7. Skin-to-skin contact in sleeping bag

**Moderate/Severe:**
1. Handle gently (rough movement can cause cardiac arrest)
2. Remove wet clothes carefully
3. Wrap in blankets/sleeping bag
4. Insulate from ground
5. Monitor breathing continuously
6. If no pulse: START CPR (may need to continue 1+ hours)
7. **URGENT evacuation** to hospital

**DO NOT:**
- Rub or massage
- Apply direct heat (hot water, fire)
- Give alcohol
- Rewarm too quickly (can cause shock)
