6. Water condenses, drips into container

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Removes everything (100%)
- ✅ Can use seawater, urine (survival)
- ✅ No filters to replace
- ✅ Can be improvised

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Very slow (solar still: 0.5-1L per day)
- ❌ Requires heat source or sun
- ❌ Complex setup
- ❌ Water tastes flat (no minerals)
- ❌ Not practical for large volumes

## Multi-Barrier Approach (Best Practice)

**For Maximum Safety - Use Multiple Methods:**

### Example 1: Suspect Water
1. **Pre-filter** through cloth (remove sediment)
2. **Filter** with 0.2μm filter (remove bacteria/protozoa)
3. **Chemical** or **UV** treatment (kill viruses)

### Example 2: Clear Stream
1. **Filter** with 0.1μm filter
2. **Optional:** Chemical backup if viral risk

### Example 3: Murky Pond
1. **Settle** overnight or flocculate (alum)
2. **Pre-filter** through cloth
3. **Boil** for 1-3 minutes

### Example 4: Questionable Urban Supply
1. **Filter** through carbon (remove chlorine/taste)
2. **UV** treatment (kill pathogens)

### Example 5: Seawater (Survival)
1. **Distill** or **RO** (remove salt)
2. **Optional:** Chemical treatment (extra safety)

## Water Source Risk Assessment

| Source | Risk Level | Recommended Method | Backup Method |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Mountain stream (clear, fast-flowing) | Low-Moderate | Filter 0.2μm | Boil |
| Lake/pond (clear) | Moderate | Filter + chemical | Boil |
| Lake/pond (murky) | High | Boil | Filter + chemical |
| River (downstream of town) | High | Boil or Filter + UV | Multi-barrier |
| Rainwater (collected) | Low | Filter 0.2μm | Chemical |
| Snow/ice (melted) | Low | Filter 0.2μm | Boil |
| Muddy/turbid water | Very High | Settle + boil | Filter + boil |
| Stagnant water | Extreme | Boil | Avoid if possible |
| Seawater | N/A (salt) | RO or Distill | Don't drink untreated |
| Urine (survival only) | Extreme | Distill only | Don't drink untreated |

---

## Emergency Pre-Filtration

**When water is very murky:**

### Settling
1. Fill container 3/4
2. Let sit 2-12 hours (longer = better)
3. Sediment settles to bottom
4. Carefully pour off clear water from top
5. Discard bottom 1/4 with sediment

### Cloth Filtration
1. Use tight-weave cloth (bandana, shirt, cotton)
2. Pour water through multiple times
3. **Only removes sediment, NOT pathogens**
4. Always follow with proper purification

### Sand Filter (Improvised)
1. Cut bottom off plastic bottle
2. Layer (bottom to top):
   - Fine cloth
   - Sand (fine - 10cm)
   - Charcoal/ash (5cm)
   - Gravel (5cm)
   - Cloth (top)
3. Pour water through
4. **Only improves clarity, doesn't purify**

### Flocculation (Alum)
1. Add small pinch of alum (aluminum sulfate) per liter
2. Stir for 5 minutes
3. Let settle 1-2 hours
4. Particles clump, sink
5. Pour off clear water
6. **Follow with purification**

---

## Method Selection Flowchart

**Ask These Questions:**

1. **How murky is the water?**
   - Clear → Any method
   - Murky → Pre-filter first, then boil or chemical

2. **Is viral contamination likely?**
   - Yes (urban, developing countries) → Boil, UV, or 0.02μm filter
   - No (wilderness, Australia) → Any method

3. **How much time do I have?**
   - Immediate → Filter
   - 15-60 min → Chemical or UV
   - 5-10 min → Boil (+ cool time)
   - 6+ hours → SODIS

4. **What resources are available?**
   - Fire → Boil
   - Tablets/drops → Chemical
   - Filter device → Filter
   - Sun + bottles → SODIS
   - Nothing → Improvise (solar still, settle + boil)

5. **How much water needed?**
   - Small (<2L) → Any method
   - Large (10+ L) → Filter, chemical, or SODIS

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Not pre-filtering murky water | Clogs filters, wastes tablets | Settle or cloth filter first |
| Insufficient contact time (chemical) | Pathogens survive | Follow timing exactly (30-60 min) |
| Using scented bleach | Toxic chemicals | Unscented bleach only (5.25%) |
| Boiling for seconds only | Doesn't kill all pathogens | 1 min minimum, 3 min at altitude |
| Drinking immediately after chemical | Inadequate contact time | Wait full 30-60 minutes |
| Freezing filter | Destroys filter membrane | Store in sleeping bag in winter |
| Not backflushing filter | Reduced flow, early failure | Backflush regularly (follow manual) |
| Assuming all filters remove viruses | Most don't (0.2μm too large) | Check specs, use multi-barrier |
| Cloudy day SODIS | Insufficient UV | Wait 2 days or use other method |
| Old iodine tablets | Lost potency | Check expiration, replace every 4 years |
