## Knot Terminology

```
Standing End: Main part of rope (the long part not being used)
Working End: Free end you're tying with
Bight: U-bend in rope (doesn't cross itself)
Loop: Circle in rope (working end crosses standing end)
Turn: Wrap around object

Example:
      Working End
           ↓
          ⌐o
          ╱│╲ ← Loop
         │ │ │
         │ │ │ ← Standing End
```

## THE ESSENTIAL 10

**These 10 knots handle almost everything:**

1. Bowline - King of knots
2. Figure-8 - Stopper and loop
3. Clove Hitch - Quick attachment
4. Sheet Bend - Join ropes
5. Taut-Line Hitch - Adjustable
6. Square Knot - Quick temporary binding

---

## 1. BOWLINE (pronounced "BOH-lin")

**Use:** Creates fixed loop that won't slip or bind
**Strength:** ~60% of rope strength
**When:** Rescue loops, tie to objects, sailing

**Mnemonic:** "The rabbit comes out of the hole, around the tree, and back down the hole"

```
Step 1: Make small loop (the "hole")
        Standing End
             ↑
             o ← Small loop
            ╱│╲
           │ │ │
           │ │ │
           ↓
    Working End

Step 2: Working end comes UP through loop
             o
            ↗│╲
           │ │ │
           │ │ │
           ↑

Step 3: Goes BEHIND standing end
             o
            ╱│╲╮
           │ │ └──→ Behind
           │ │

Step 4: Back DOWN through loop
             o
            ╱╰╮
           │  │ │
           │  │ │
           ↓

Step 5: Pull tight
             ∩ ← Fixed loop
            ╱ ╲
           │   │
           │   │
            ╲ ╱
             ║
           Standing
```

**Tip:** Finish with working end on INSIDE of loop (stronger, cleaner)

**Quick check:** Loop won't slip, but can be untied even after heavy load

---

## 2. FIGURE-8 KNOT

### A. Stopper Knot (prevent rope running through)

```
Step 1: Make loop
           o
          ╱│╲
         │ │ │
         ↓

Step 2: Bring working end UNDER standing end
           o
          ╱│╲
         │ └──→
         ↓

Step 3: Thread UP through original loop
           o
          ↗╮│
         │ ││
         ↓

Step 4: Pull tight (looks like "8")
           ⌐o╮
          │ ║│
          │ ║│
           ╰o╯
            ║
```

**Use:** Stopper on end of rope (won't slip through pulley, etc.)

---

### B. Figure-8 Loop (stronger than bowline)

```
Step 1: Double rope back on itself (bight)
        ════╗
            ║
            ║

Step 2: Make figure-8 with doubled rope
        ⌐══╮
       │   ║│
       │   ║│
        ╰══╯
         ║║

Step 3: Pull tight
         ∩∩ ← Fixed loop (very strong)
        │  │
        │  │
         ╲╱
         ║
```

**Use:** Climbing, critical loads, won't slip or come undone

---

## 3. CLOVE HITCH

**Use:** Quick attachment to post/pole, adjustable
**Strength:** Moderate (can slip under variable load)
**When:** Temporary, will be attended

```
Step 1: Wrap around post
        ╭───╮
        │ │ │
        │ │ │
        Post

Step 2: Cross over first wrap
        ╭─X─╮
        │ │ │
        │ │ │

Step 3: Wrap again beside first
        ╭─X══╮
        │ │  │
        │ │  │

Step 4: Thread under second wrap
        ╭─X══╮
        │ ╰→ │
        │    │

Finished:
        ╭╧╧╮
        │XX│ ← Two half-hitches
        │││││
        Post
```

**Quick method (if can slip over top of post):**

```
1. Make two loops (same direction)
   o  o
   ↓  ↓

2. Overlap them
     o
    ╱X╲
   o   o

3. Slip over post
   ╭╧╧╮
   │XX│
   Post
```

**Tip:** Easy to adjust by sliding. NOT for critical loads (can slip).

---

## 4. SHEET BEND (joining two ropes)

**Use:** Connect two ropes (even different thicknesses)
**Strength:** Good
**When:** Extending rope, different diameters

```
Step 1: Make bight in thicker rope (blue)
        ════╗
            ║
            ║

Step 2: Thread thinner rope (red) through bight
        ════╗
           ↗║
          r ║
          e
          d

Step 3: Wrap red around behind bight
        ════╗
         ╭──║
         │r ║
         │e
         │d

Step 4: Thread red under its own standing end
        ════╗
         ╭──║
         │╭←║
         └╯
         red

Step 5: Pull tight (both ropes)
        ════╗
         ║║ ║
         ╰╯ ║
         red
```

**Double Sheet Bend (more secure):** Make second wrap in step 3

**Tip:** Working ends should be on same side when finished

---

## 5. TAUT-LINE HITCH (adjustable)

**Use:** Tent guy lines, adjustable tension
**Strength:** Good when loaded
**When:** Need to adjust tension easily

```
Step 1: Wrap around standing end (toward anchor)
            →→→ To tent peg
             ║
             o ← First wrap
            ╱║
           │ ║
           ↓ ║

Step 2: Second wrap (same direction)
             ║
             o
             o ← Second wrap
            ╱║
           │ ║

Step 3: Third wrap (ABOVE first two, opposite direction)
             o ← Third wrap (crosses)
            ╱║╲
           │ ║ │
           │ o │
           │ o │

Step 4: Pull tight
           ═╪═ ← Can slide when unloaded
            ║  ← Grips when loaded
            ║
```

**How to use:** Slide knot along rope to adjust tension. Grips under load, slides when slack.

---

## 6. SQUARE KNOT (Reef Knot)

**Use:** Tie two ends of SAME rope, temporary binding
**Strength:** WEAK (can slip)
**WARNING:** NOT for joining two ropes, NOT for critical loads

```
Step 1: Cross left over right
          L   R
           ╲ ╱
            X
           ╱ ╲

Step 2: Tie simple overhand
           ║╲ ╱║
            ╲X╱
             ▼

Step 3: Cross right over left (opposite of step 1)
            ║║
           ╱╲╱╲
          R  X  L
           ╲╱╲╱

Step 4: Pull tight
           ═══
            X
           ╱ ╲
          ╱   ╲

Finished (symmetrical):
          ═╗ ╔═
           ╰X╯
```

**Remember:** "Right over left, left over right" OR "Left over right, right over left"

**WARNING SIGNS (don't use if):**
- Joining different rope types/sizes → Use Sheet Bend instead
- Critical load → Use Figure-8 or Bowline instead
- Will be unattended → Use more secure knot

**Good for:** Tying package, bandage, temporary bundling

---

## 7. TRUCKER'S HITCH (mechanical advantage)

**Use:** Secure loads, create VERY tight line (3:1 advantage)
**Strength:** Excellent for tensioning
**When:** Tie down cargo, secure tarp tight

```
Step 1: Create fixed loop partway along rope (use Figure-8 on bight)
         ∩ ← Fixed loop
        ║ ║
        ║ ║
        ↓ ↓
    Anchor End  Working End

Step 2: Working end goes to second anchor, back through loop
         ∩
        ║ ║
        ║  ╲
        ↓   ↘
    Anchor    Anchor
              ↑
           Working end pulls here

Step 3: Pull working end HARD (3:1 mechanical advantage)
         ∩
        ║ ║ ← Pulley effect
        ║  ╲
        ↓   ╲ ← PULL!

Step 4: Secure with two half-hitches around standing line
         ∩
        ║ ║
        ║  ╲══╮
        ↓     o ← Half-hitches
              o
```

**Tip:** This knot lets you pull line VERY tight (3× force). Great for securing loads on roof racks, creating tight shelter lines.

---

## 8. PRUSIK KNOT (friction hitch)

**Use:** Grips when loaded, slides when not (climbing, rescue)
**Requirements:** Smaller diameter rope around larger
**When:** Backup for climbing, ascending rope

```
Step 1: Make loop from small cord (double fisherman's)
        o─────o
         Prusik loop

Step 2: Wrap loop around main rope (2-3 times)
          ║ Main rope
        ╭─╫─╮
        │ ║ │
        │ ║ │
         ╰╯

Step 3: Thread loop through itself
          ║
        ╭─╫→o
        │ ║  ↓
        │ ║  o
         ╰╯

Finished (grips when loaded):
          ║
        ══╬══ ← Grips rope
        ╭─║─╮
        o   o ← Can attach to this loop
```

**How it works:** Slide freely when unloaded, grip tightly when weight applied

**Use:** Climbing safety, ascending rope, adjustable attachment

---

## 9. CONSTRICTOR KNOT

**Use:** VERY tight binding (almost permanent)
**Strength:** Excellent
**When:** Bundling, whipping rope end, won't slip

```
Step 1: Wrap around object
        ╭───╮
        │   │
        Object

Step 2: Cross over (like clove hitch start)
        ╭─X─╮
        │   │

Step 3: Bring working end UNDER first wrap AND OVER standing end
        ╭╧╧╮
        │╬╬│ ← Locks tight
        │││││

Finished:
        ╭══╮
        │╬╬│ ← VERY tight (may need to cut to remove)
        Object
```

**WARNING:** Often impossible to untie. Plan to cut it off. Use only when permanent binding needed.

**Good for:** Whipping rope end, securing bundle permanently, emergency repair

---

## 10. DOUBLE FISHERMAN'S KNOT

**Use:** Join two ropes securely (climbing, critical loads)
**Strength:** Excellent
**When:** Joining ropes, making prusik loops

```
Step 1: Tie overhand knot in rope A around rope B
          B══════
            ╭o─A
            │║
            ╰╯

Step 2: Tie second overhand in same rope (double)
          B══════
           ╭╭o─A
           ║║║
           ╰╰╯

Step 3: Repeat with rope B around rope A
          ╭╭o═══╗╮
         A║║║   ║║o─B
          ╰╰╯   ╰╰╯

Step 4: Pull both ropes (knots slide together)
         A════║║════B
              ╬╬ ← Very secure
```

**Tip:** Knots should have long tails (5-10cm). Test by pulling hard before use.

---

## SPECIALTY KNOTS

### Fishing Knots

**Improved Clinch Knot (line to hook):**

```
1. Thread line through hook eye (10-15cm)
2. Wrap working end around standing line 5-7 times
3. Thread end back through loop near eye
4. Thread through large loop created
5. Moisten and pull tight
6. Trim close

      Hook eye
         o
         ║ooooo ← Wraps
         ║║
         ╰╯ ← Through loops
```

**Palomar Knot (stronger alternative):**

```
1. Double line, thread through hook eye
2. Tie overhand knot with doubled line (don't tighten)
3. Pass hook through loop
4. Pull tight

    Strong and simple
```

---

### Climbing Knots

**Figure-8 Follow-Through (tie-in to harness):**

```
1. Tie figure-8 in rope (leave long tail)
2. Thread tail through harness loops
3. Follow original knot path exactly (doubling it)
4. Leave 15-30cm tail
5. Check carefully!

Critical: Lives depend on this. Get professional instruction.
```

## Knot Strength Comparison

```
╔════════════════════╦═══════════════════════════════╗
║ KNOT              ║ % OF ROPE STRENGTH (approx)   ║
╠════════════════════╬═══════════════════════════════╣
║ No knot (splice)  ║ 90-95%                        ║
║ Figure-8 Loop     ║ 75-80%                        ║
║ Bowline           ║ 60-70%                        ║
║ Sheet Bend        ║ 55-60%                        ║
║ Clove Hitch       ║ 60-65%                        ║
║ Square Knot       ║ 43-47% (WEAK!)                ║
║ Overhand          ║ 40-50% (very weak)            ║
╚════════════════════╩═══════════════════════════════╝
```

**Key point:** Every knot weakens rope. Choose appropriately.

## Practice Progression

### Week 1: Core 3
```
├─ Bowline (30 reps until automatic)
├─ Figure-8 (both stopper and loop)
└─ Clove Hitch (practice speed)
```

### Week 2: Joining & Adjusting
```
├─ Sheet Bend
├─ Taut-Line Hitch
└─ Square Knot (and when NOT to use it)
```

### Week 3: Advanced
```
├─ Trucker's Hitch
├─ Prusik
├─ Constrictor
└─ Double Fisherman's
```

### Week 4: Application
```
├─ Set up tent with guy lines (Taut-Line)
├─ Secure load (Trucker's Hitch)
├─ Join ropes (Sheet Bend, Double Fisherman's)
└─ Emergency scenarios (Bowline rescue loop)
```

---

## Common Mistakes

**All knots:**
- Not dressing (arranging neatly before tightening)
- Not setting (pulling tight properly)
- Leaving short tails (5-10cm minimum)
- Wrong knot for application

**Bowline:**
- Working end on outside of loop (weaker)
- Tail too short
- Not cinching tight

**Square Knot:**
- Using for joining different ropes (slips!)
- Critical loads (weak!)
- Becomes "Granny Knot" if crossed wrong (very weak)

**Clove Hitch:**
- Trusting for unattended critical load (can slip)
- Not dressing crossover properly

---

## Knot Applications by Scenario

### Camping/Hiking

```
Guy lines → Taut-Line Hitch
Hang bear bag → Bowline + Trucker's Hitch
Bundle gear → Clove Hitch, Constrictor
Quick tie-off → Clove Hitch
Emergency shelter → Bowline, Taut-Line, Trucker's
```

### Marine/Sailing

```
Tie to dock → Bowline, Clove Hitch
Join lines → Sheet Bend
Temporary tie → Clove Hitch
Permanent loop → Bowline
```

### Climbing (get professional training!)

```
Tie-in → Figure-8 Follow-Through
Secure rope → Figure-8 on bight
Backup → Prusik
Join ropes → Double Fisherman's
```

### Emergency/Rescue

```
Rescue loop → Bowline (one-handed method)
Secure victim → Bowline
Lower person → Figure-8 (strong)
Friction control → Prusik
```

### Everyday

```
Tie package → Square Knot
Hang clothesline → Bowline + Taut-Line
Secure tarp → Trucker's Hitch
Bundle → Constrictor
```

---

## One-Handed Bowline (emergency rescue)

**When:** Injured, one hand free, need rescue loop

```
1. Make small loop in working end, hold in mouth/teeth
2. Standing end around waist/tree
3. Bring working end (with loop) up
4. Thread standing end through loop
5. Work loop behind standing end
6. Thread standing end back through loop
7. Pull tight with available hand

Practice this. Could save your life.
```

---

## Testing Your Knots

**Before trusting any knot:**

```
1. Visual check
   ├─ Correct form (matches diagram)
   ├─ Neatly dressed (rope lies flat, no crosses)
   ├─ Properly set (tight)
   └─ Adequate tail (5-10cm minimum)

2. Gentle test pull
   ├─ Both directions
   ├─ Knot should tighten, not slip
   └─ No movement unexpected

3. Load test (for critical use)
   ├─ Gradually increase load
   ├─ Watch for slipping
   ├─ Stop before breaking (unless testing to failure)
   └─ If any doubt, retie

4. Final check
   ├─ Correct knot for application
   ├─ Rope suitable for load
   ├─ Backup knot if critical (Figure-8 stopper after bowline, etc.)
   └─ Inspect throughout use
```

---

## Rope Care

**Knots work best with good rope:**

```
Inspection:
├─ Check for fraying
├─ Look for chemical damage (stiff, discolored)
├─ Flex rope (should be supple)
├─ Check for cuts/abrasion
└─ UV damage (faded, stiff)

Cleaning:
├─ Mild soap, water
├─ Air dry (not direct sun)
├─ Never heat dry
└─ Coil properly for storage

Storage:
├─ Cool, dry place
├─ Loosely coiled
├─ Away from chemicals
└─ Out of UV light

Retirement:
├─ Climbing rope: per manufacturer (use log, falls)
├─ General rope: when worn, stiff, damaged
└─ If in doubt, throw it out (your life > cost of rope)
```

**Key Principle:** "A knot is only as good as the person who tied it."

**Practice regularly:** Muscle memory is crucial. 10 minutes practice per week keeps skills sharp.

**Safety First:** If lives depend on it, get professional training. This guide is for general knowledge only.

**Remember:** "One good knot tied well is worth ten fancy knots tied poorly."
