## The Essential 8 Knots

**Master these 8 knots to handle 90% of survival situations:**

1. **Bowline** - Fixed loop, rescue, securing rope
2. **Clove Hitch** - Quick securing, adjustable
3. **Taut-Line Hitch** - Adjustable tension (guy lines)
4. **Sheet Bend** - Joining different ropes
5. **Square Knot** - Joining same-size ropes
6. **Figure-8 Loop** - Strong fixed loop
7. **Prusik Knot** - Sliding friction hitch
8. **Trucker's Hitch** - Mechanical advantage, tight lashing

## Loops (Non-Sliding)

### Bowline
**"King of Knots"**

**Uses:** Rescue, securing around trees, fixed loop, won't slip or bind

**How to Tie:**
```
1. Make small loop ("rabbit hole") in standing part
2. Pass working end up through loop ("rabbit comes out")
3. Around standing part ("around the tree")
4. Back down through loop ("back in hole")
5. Tighten by pulling standing part

Memory: "Rabbit comes out of hole, around tree, back in hole"
```

**Strength:** 60% of rope strength
**Pros:** Easy to untie after load, secure
**Cons:** Can work loose with repeated loading (use backup knot)

---

### Figure-8 Loop

## Rope Care

### Inspection Before Use

**Check for:**
- Fraying (fuzzy, broken fibers)
- Cuts, abrasions
- Stiffness (UV damage, dirt)
- Discoloration (chemical damage)
- Flat spots (core damage)
- Melting (heat damage)

**Retire rope if:** Any damage to core, severe abrasion, >5 years old (nylon), fell more than factor-2

### Storage

- Clean before storage (mild soap, rinse well)
- Dry completely (never store wet)
- Coil or stuff in bag (don't coil climbing rope)
- Store in cool, dry, dark place
- Away from chemicals, solvents, batteries
- Off concrete floor (absorbs moisture)

### Rope Strength Reduction

| Condition | Strength Loss |
|-----------|---------------|
| New rope | 0% (baseline) |
| Wet | 10-15% |
| Frozen | 20-30% |
| UV exposure (1 year) | 20-50% |
| Sharp bend/knot | 40-60% |
| Over 5 years old | Retire |
| Any core damage | Retire |

## Practice Recommendations

### Learning Sequence

**Week 1-2:** Master Essential 8
- Bowline (50 reps minimum)
- Figure-8 loop (50 reps)
- Clove hitch (50 reps)
- Practice one-handed, eyes closed, in dark

**Week 3-4:** Specialty knots
- Sheet bend variations
- Lashings
- Friction hitches

**Ongoing:** Weekly practice (muscle memory fades)

### Practice Tips

1. **Use colored rope** initially (see wraps clearly)
2. **Tie slowly** at first (speed comes with practice)
3. **Check against photos** (mirror image can confuse)
4. **Practice in dark** (emergencies don't wait)
5. **Teach someone else** (best way to solidify knowledge)
6. **Test under load** (see how knot behaves)
7. **Time yourself** (track improvement)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Square knot for critical loads | Can capsize | Use sheet bend or fisherman's |
| Working ends too short | Knot slips through | Leave 10× rope diameter minimum |
| Bowline without backup | Can loosen with movement | Add overhand on working end |
| Overhand knot in climbing rope | Very hard to untie | Use figure-8 instead |
| Wet knots under load | Freeze, damage fiber | Dry rope before storage |
| Not dressing knot | Weaker, unpredictable | Pull all parts tight evenly |
| Using damaged rope | Sudden failure | Inspect before use, retire damaged rope |

---

## Knot Terminology

- **Standing part:** Main length of rope (not used in tying)
- **Working end:** End used to tie knot
- **Bight:** Loop or fold without crossing rope
- **Loop:** Rope crossing itself
- **Turn:** One wrap around object
- **Hitch:** Knot tied around object (fails if object removed)
- **Bend:** Knot joining two ropes
- **Dressing:** Arranging knot before tightening
- **Setting:** Pulling knot tight
- **Capsizing:** Knot changing form (often failing)
- **Frapping:** Wrapping between lashing turns (tightens)

## Safety Notes

⚠️ **Practice before emergency** - Stress makes simple tasks hard
⚠️ **Inspect knots before loading** - One mistake can be fatal
⚠️ **Never use square knot for critical loads** - Will capsize
⚠️ **Leave adequate tail** - Minimum 10× rope diameter
⚠️ **Test under light load first** - Verify knot correct before full load
⚠️ **Climbing knots require training** - Take certified course
⚠️ **Backup critical knots** - Stopper knot on working end
