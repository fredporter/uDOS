## 🔄 Each Round Checklist

### 1. Review (Day 1)
```bash
# Start fresh session

[MODULE|COMMAND]

# Document current state
# Create: memory/research/v1.0.x-review.md
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Audit existing commands
- [ ] Test all features
- [ ] Identify gaps and issues
- [ ] Document findings

### 2. Develop (Days 2-3)
```python
# Edit handler file

    """New feature implementation"""
    # Add feature code
    return result
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement new features
- [ ] Add enhancements
- [ ] Fix identified bugs
- [ ] Write clean, documented code

### 3. Integrate (Day 4)
```python
# Update main router if needed
# Test integration with other handlers

# Example: core/uDOS_commands.py
if module == "SYSTEM":
    return self.system_handler.handle(...)
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Connect with core system
- [ ] Test handler integration
- [ ] Verify dependencies work
- [ ] Check backward compatibility

### 4. Document (Day 5)
```markdown

## NEW_COMMAND
Description, usage, examples

# Update docs/guides/component-guide.md
Complete guide with screenshots
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update Command Reference
- [ ] Create/update guide docs
- [ ] Add inline code comments
- [ ] Write examples

### 5. Test (Days 6-7)
```bash
# Terminal testing loop
./start_udos.sh

# Test each feature
[MODULE|COMMAND*param1*param2]

# Use assistant for feedback
[ASSISTANT|ANALYZE*current implementation]
[ASSISTANT|EXPLAIN*what could be improved]

# Document results
# Save to: memory/research/v1.0.x-testing.md
```

**Test Categories**:
- [ ] **Functional**: Does it work?
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: What breaks it?
- [ ] **Performance**: Is it fast enough?
- [ ] **UX**: Is it intuitive?
- [ ] **Integration**: Does it play well with others?

### 6. Improve (Day 7)
```bash
# Based on test results, refine:
# - Error messages
# - Performance
# - UX flow
# - Documentation

# Re-test after changes
# Iterate until satisfied
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Fix bugs found in testing
- [ ] Optimize based on feedback
- [ ] Polish UX and messages
- [ ] Final documentation pass
