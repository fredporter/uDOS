# Wiki Candidates (Staging)

This folder is a **staging area** for long‑form drafts and spec‑level documents that may later be summarized into the user‑facing wiki.

## Promotion Policy

Documents in `docs/wiki-candidates/` are **not** part of the public wiki by default. A document is promoted only when it is:

- **Stable** (unlikely to change week‑to‑week)
- **Beginner‑friendly** (short, clear, minimal jargon)
- **Canonical** (single source of truth for the topic)
- **Non‑duplicative** (does not repeat `/docs` specs)

## How Promotion Works

1. Draft lives here with full technical detail.
2. A **concise wiki page** is created in `/wiki/` (one page per feature).
3. The wiki page links back to the full draft here.

## What Stays Here

- Long‑form specs
- Deep technical details
- Delivery notes and checklists
- Internal design drafts

## What Goes in `/wiki/`

- Short, user‑friendly summaries
- Entry points and “getting started” docs
- One‑page feature overviews

## Example

- Full spec: `docs/wiki-candidates/BEACON-PORTAL.md`
- Wiki summary: `wiki/Beacon-Architecture-Summary.md`
