# uDOS v1.4.3 Release Notes (Consolidated v1.4+)

Release date: 2026-02-19
Status: Released

This document consolidates v1.4-stream release notes into one canonical reference for v1.4.3.

---

## Summary

uDOS v1.4.3 closes the v1.4 release stream by combining containerization readiness, the LIBRARY command surface, and modularization cleanup into one stable release narrative.

## Highlights

### Container readiness
- TOYBOX adapter lifecycle migrated to FastAPI lifespan handlers (deprecated `on_event` hooks removed from active path).
- Sonic Screwdriver container entrypoint corrected and validated via smoke gate.
- Songscribe/Groovebox Dockerfile added and validated via smoke gate.
- Compose profile matrix validator added for required `docker compose --profile` combinations.
- Container capability matrix contract validates lane definitions, artifacts, and smoke-gate coverage.

### LIBRARY command surface
- Added `LIBRARY` command with `STATUS`, `SYNC`, `INFO`, `LIST`, and `HELP` subcommands.
- Wired through dispatcher, command help, ghost mode guard, and autocomplete.
- Backed by `LibraryManagerService` for discovery and status operations.
- Added CI smoke gate and unit-test coverage for command behavior.

### Modularization + release gates
- Added `library-command` lane to capability matrix with `skip_compose` support for non-container lanes.
- Unified release preflight aggregates v1.4 gates and report artifacts.
- v1.3.25 contract freeze baseline rebased after command-surface cleanup in the v1.4 cycle.

## CI Gates

- `check_v1_4_0_toybox_lifespan_readiness.py` — PASS
- `check_v1_4_0_sonic_docker_smoke.py` — PASS
- `check_v1_4_0_groovebox_docker_smoke.py` — PASS
- `check_v1_4_0_compose_profile_matrix.py` — PASS
- `check_v1_4_0_container_capability_matrix.py` — PASS
- `check_v1_4_0_library_command_smoke.py` — PASS

## Report artifacts

- `memory/reports/v1_4_0_release_preflight.json`
- `memory/reports/v1_4_0_container_capability_matrix.json`
- `memory/reports/v1_4_0_compose_profile_matrix.json`

## Deferred to v1.4+

- Groovebox Songscribe parser pipeline (tokenizer, AST, audio synthesis, MIDI/WAV export, transport layer).
- Docker/container readiness for Groovebox is complete; full parser/synthesis pipeline continues in the active v1.4+ workstream.
