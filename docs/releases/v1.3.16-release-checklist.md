## Scope

This checklist gates release of the v1.3.16 core command refactor:

- Core/Wizard ownership split
- No-shims command policy
- `HEALTH`/`VERIFY` split
- TS-backed `DRAW PAT` and `RUN DATA`
- Legacy handler removal

## Release Gates

### Contract and dispatch
- [x] `core/config/ucli_command_contract_v1_3_16.json` is source of truth
- [x] Wizard contract loader points to v1.3.16 contract
- [x] Dispatcher parity check passes
- [x] Removed commands hard-fail with migration guidance

### Command behavior
- [x] `HEALTH` runs offline/local checks
- [x] `VERIFY` runs TS/runtime checks
- [x] `DRAW PAT ...` works for list/render operations
- [x] `RUN DATA ...` works for list/validate/build/regen paths
- [x] `WIZARD PROV ...`, `WIZARD INTEG ...`, `WIZARD CHECK` are Wizard-owned surfaces

### Boundary and policy
- [x] Core no-network import policy check passes
- [x] Core stdlib boundary check passes
- [x] Core TS dependency policy check passes
- [x] Wizard venv policy wired (`ucli wizard install`, `ucli wizard doctor`)

### Legacy removal
- [x] Removed legacy modules:
  - `core/commands/shakedown_handler.py`
  - `core/commands/pattern_handler.py`
  - `core/commands/dataset_handler.py`
  - `core/commands/integration_handler.py`
  - `core/commands/provider_handler.py`
- [x] `core/commands/__init__.py` no longer exports removed handlers

### Documentation
- [x] Command manual updated
- [x] Wiki pages updated
- [x] Contract/spec docs updated
- [x] Decision docs updated for venv/core split + command ownership

### CI gates
- [x] Policy guardrail job fails on violations

- [x] Python test job is hard-fail (no `continue-on-error`)
