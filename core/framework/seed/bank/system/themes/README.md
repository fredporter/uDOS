# Theme seeds

These JSON files seed the lightweight theme system used by the Core TUI.
Each object contains a `name`, optional `description`, and a simple `replacements`
map so strings printed by the Core TUI can be swapped before they hit the terminal.

Copy of this folder lands in `/memory/bank/system/themes/` on first run; edit the
files there to create new voices without altering the seeded versions.
