## Inspiration

### Retro Computing Heritage

uDOS pays tribute to the golden age of personal computing:

- **MS-DOS** — Command-line power and simplicity
- **Commodore 64** — Accessible programming for all
- **Apple II** — Educational computing pioneer
- **Unix/Linux** — Philosophy of simple, composable tools
- **BeOS** — Elegant, efficient system design

### Modern Influences

Contemporary projects and technologies:

- **Markdown** — Readable, writable documentation
- **TypeScript** — Type-safe JavaScript evolution
- **Python** — Clear, expressive programming
- **Git** — Distributed version control
- **Open Source Movement** — Collaborative development

---

## Retro Computing Tribute

Elements of uDOS inspired by vintage computing aesthetics:

- ASCII art and text-based interfaces
- Command-line interaction patterns
- Retro color schemes
- Batch file/shell script paradigms

**Important:** These are artistic tributes and original creative works. uDOS does not infringe on any copyrights or trademarks. All references to historical computing platforms are respectful acknowledgments of computing history.
